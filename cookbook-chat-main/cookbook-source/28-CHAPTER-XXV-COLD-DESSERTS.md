Serve with sugar and cream.

413

### Boiled Custard

2 cups scalded milk

Yolks 3 eggs

¼ cup sugar

⅛ teaspoon salt

½ teaspoon vanilla

Beat eggs slightly, add sugar and salt; stir constantly while adding gradually hot milk. Cook in double boiler, continue stirring until mixture thickens and a coating is formed on the spoon, strain immediately; chill and flavor. If cooked too long the custard will curdle; should this happen, by using a Dover egg-beater it may be restored to a smooth consistency, but custard will not be as thick. Eggs should be beaten slightly for custard, that it may be of smooth, thick consistency. To prevent scum from forming, cover with a perforated tin. When eggs are scarce, use yolks two eggs and one-half tablespoon corn-starch.

### Tipsy Pudding

Flavor Boiled Custard with Sherry wine, and pour over slices of stale sponge cake; cover with Cream Sauce I or II.

¾ cup apple pulp

Powdered sugar

Pare, quarter, and core four sour apples, steam until soft, and rub through sieve; there should be three-fourths cup 414apple pulp.

### Prune Whip

⅓ lb. prunes

Whites 5 eggs

½ cup sugar

½ tablespoon lemon juice

Pick over and wash prunes, then soak several hours in cold water to cover; cook in same water until soft; remove stones and rub prunes through a strainer, add sugar, and cook five minutes; the mixture should be of the consistency of marmalade.

Sprinkle with nutmeg, and bake in slow oven until firm, which may be readily determined by running a silver knife through custard; if knife comes out clean, custard is done. During baking, care must be taken that water surrounding mould does not reach boiling-point, or custard will whey. Always bear in mind that eggs and milk in combination must be cooked at a low temperature. For _cup custards_ 415allow four eggs to four cups milk; for large moulded custard, six eggs; if less eggs are used custard is liable to crack when turned on a serving dish.

5 eggs

½ teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon vanilla

½ cup sugar

Put sugar in omelet pan, stir constantly over hot part of range until melted to a syrup of light brown color.

As soon as sugar is melted in milk, add mixture gradually to eggs slightly beaten; add salt and flavoring, then strain in buttered mould. Bake as custard. Chill, and serve with Caramel Sauce.

cut in pieces

### To Whip Cream

Thin and heavy cream are both used in making and garnishing desserts.

_Heavy cream_ is bought in half-pint, pint, and quart glass jars, and usually retails at sixty cents per quart; _thin_ or _strawberry cream_ comes in glass jars or may be bought in bulk, and usually retails for thirty cents per quart. Heavy cream is very rich; for which reason, when whipped without 426being diluted, it is employed as a garnish; even when so used, it is generally diluted with one-fourth to one-third its bulk in milk; when used in combination with other ingredients for making desserts, it is diluted from one-half to two-thirds its bulk in milk. Thin cream is whipped without being diluted. Cream should be thoroughly chilled for whipping. Turn cream to be whipped into a bowl (care being taken not to select too large a bowl), and set in pan of crushed ice, to which water is added that cream may be quickly chilled; without addition of water, cream will not be so thoroughly chilled.

For whipping heavy cream undiluted, or diluted with one-third or less its bulk in milk, use Dover egg-beater; undiluted heavy cream if beaten a moment too long will come to butter. Heavy cream diluted, whipped, sweetened, and flavored, is often served with puddings, and called Cream Sauce.

Thin cream is whipped by using a whip churn, as is heavy cream when diluted with one-half to two-thirds its bulk in milk. Place churn in bowl containing cream, hold down cover with left hand, with right hand work dasher with quick downward and slow upward motions; avoid raising dasher too high in cylinder, thus escaping spattering of cream. The first whip which appears should be stirred into cream, as air bubbles are too large and will break; second whip should be removed by spoonfuls to a strainer, strainer to be placed in a pan, as some cream will drain through. The first cream which drains through may be turned into bowl to be rewhipped, and continue whipping as long as possible.

There will be some cream left in bowl which does not come above perforations in whip churn, and cannot be whipped. Cream which remains may be scalded and used to dissolve gelatine when making desserts which require gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. By following these directions one need have no difficulty, if cream is of right consistency; always bearing in mind heavy cream must be whipped with a Dover egg-beater; thin cream must be whipped with a churn.
