_ANNOUNCEMENT OF COURSES_

The aim of this School is to afford such instruction as will elevate cookery to its proper place as a science and an art. The courses are so arranged, combining the practical and the theoretical, that the knowledge gained may be applied to daily living. The needs of the body are not forgotten. The classification, composition, and nutritive value of foods are considered. The correct proportion of each of the food-principles necessary for a day’s ration, for those of different age, sex, and occupation, is emphasized, thus enabling the pupil to arrange well-balanced dietaries. Attention is paid to the selection of supplies with reference to economy and utility, thus tending to develop an interest in marketing and accounts.
