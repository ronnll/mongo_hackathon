# CHAPTER XXI: SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS

Salads, which constitute a course in almost every dinner, but a few years since seldom appeared on the table. They are now made in an endless variety of ways, and are composed of meat, fish, vegetables (alone or in combination) or fruits, with the addition of a dressing. The salad plants, lettuce, watercress, chiccory, cucumbers, etc., contain but little nutriment, but are cooling, refreshing, and assist in stimulating the appetite. They are valuable for the water and potash salts they contain. The olive oil, which usually forms the largest part of the dressing, furnishes nutriment, and is of much value to the system.

Salads made of greens should always be served crisp and cold. The vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed to stand in cold or ice-water until crisp, then drained and spread on a towel and set aside in a cold place until serving time. See Lettuce, page 294. Dressing may be added at table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed to stand in dressing they will soon wilt. It should be remembered that winter greens are raised under glass and should be treated as any other hothouse plant. Lettuce will be affected by a change of temperature and wilt just as quickly as delicate flowers.

Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well utilized in salads, but are best mixed with French Dressing and allowed to stand in a cold place one hour before serving. Where several vegetables are used in the same salad they should be marinated separately, and arranged for serving just before sending to table.

323Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, cut in small cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French Dressing before combining with vegetables. Fish should be flaked or cut in cubes.

Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with salt and pepper, add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vinegar is added before oil, the greens will become wet, and oil will not cling, but settle to bottom of bowl.

**A Chapon.** Remove a small piece from end of French loaf and rub over with a clove of garlic, first dipped in salt. Place in bottom of salad bowl before arranging salad. A chapon is often used in vegetable salads, and gives an agreeable additional flavor.

**To Marinate.** The word marinate, as used in cookery, means to add salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad ingredient or mixture, then allow to let stand until well seasoned.

### SALAD DRESSINGS

#### French Dressing

½ teaspoon salt

#### Cream Dressing I

½ tablespoon salt

1 egg slightly beaten

2½ tablespoons melted butter

¾ cup cream

¼ cup vinegar

Mix ingredients in order given, adding vinegar very slowly. Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly until mixture thickens, strain and cool.

#### Cream Dressing II

1 teaspoon mustard

1 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons flour

1½ teaspoons powdered sugar

Few grains cayenne

1 teaspoon melted butter

Yolk 1 egg

⅓ cup hot vinegar

½ cup thick cream

#### Boiled Dressing I

½ tablespoon salt

1 teaspoon mustard

1½ tablespoons sugar

Few grains cayenne

½ tablespoon flour

Yolks 2 eggs

1½ tablespoons melted butter

¾ cup milk

¼ cup vinegar

Mix dry ingredients, add yolks of eggs slightly beaten, butter, milk, and vinegar very slowly. Cook over boiling water until mixture thickens; strain and cool.

325

#### Boiled Dressing II

Yolks 4 eggs

½ cup olive oil

4 tablespoons vinegar

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1½ teaspoons salt

3 teaspoons powdered sugar

1 pint whipped cream

Beat yolks of eggs slightly, add gradually one-half of the oil and lemon juice. Cook in double boiler until mixture thickens; chill, and add gradually remaining oil, salt, and sugar. Just before serving add cream.

#### German Dressing

½ cup thick cream

3 tablespoons vinegar

¼ teaspoon salt

Few grains pepper

Beat cream until stiff, using Dover Egg-beater. Add salt, pepper, and vinegar very slowly, continuing the beating.

½ cup rich chicken stock

½ cup vinegar

Yolks 5 eggs

2 tablespoons mixed mustard

1 teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon pepper

Few grains cayenne

½ cup thick cream

⅓ cup melted butter

Reduce stock in which a fowl has been cooked to one-half cupful. Add vinegar, yolks of eggs slightly beaten, mustard, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly until mixture thickens. Strain, add cream and melted butter, then cool.

#### Oil Dressing I

4 “hard-boiled” eggs

4 tablespoons oil

4 tablespoons vinegar

½ tablespoon sugar

½ teaspoon mustard

½ teaspoon salt

Few grains cayenne

White 1 egg

Force yolks of “hard-boiled” eggs through a strainer, then work, using a silver or wooden spoon, until smooth. Add sugar, mustard, salt, and cayenne, and when well blended add gradually oil and vinegar, stirring and beating until thoroughly mixed; then cut and fold in white of egg beaten until stiff.

326

#### Oil Dressing II

1½ teaspoons mustard

1 teaspoon salt

2 teaspoons powdered sugar

Few grains cayenne

2 tablespoons oil

⅓ cup vinegar diluted with cold water to make one-half cup

2 eggs, slightly beaten

Mix dry ingredients, add egg and oil gradually, stirring constantly until thoroughly mixed; then add diluted vinegar. Cook over boiling water until mixture thickens; strain and cool.

#### Mayonnaise Dressing I

1 teaspoon mustard

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon powdered sugar

Few grains cayenne

Yolks 2 eggs

2 tablespoons lemon juice

2 tablespoons vinegar

1½ cups olive oil

Mix dry ingredients, add egg yolks, and when well mixed add one-half teaspoon of vinegar. Add oil gradually, at first drop by drop, and stir constantly. As mixture thickens, thin with vinegar or lemon juice. Add oil, and vinegar or lemon juice alternately, until all is used, stirring or beating constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a curdled appearance. A smooth consistency may be restored by taking yolk of another egg and adding curdled mixture slowly to it. It is desirable to have bowl containing mixture placed in a larger bowl of crushed ice, to which a small quantity of water has been added. Olive oil for making Mayonnaise should always be thoroughly chilled. A silver fork, wire whisk, small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater may be used as preferred. If one has a Keystone Egg-beater, dressing may be made very quickly by its use. Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon liquefies when added to meat or vegetables; therefore it should be added just before serving time.

#### Mayonnaise Dressing II

Use same ingredients as for Mayonnaise Dressing I, adding mashed yolk of a “hard-boiled” egg to dry ingredients.

_French Chef_

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon powdered sugar

2 tablespoons vinegar

¾ cup olive oil

Remove and mash the inside of potato. Add mustard, salt, and powdered sugar; add one tablespoon vinegar, and rub mixture through a fine sieve. Add slowly oil and remaining vinegar. By the taste one would hardly realize eggs were not used in the making.

**To Curl Celery.** Cut thick stalks of celery in two-inch pieces. With a sharp knife, beginning at outside of stalks, make five cuts parallel with each other, extending one-third the length of pieces. Make six cuts at right angles to cuts already made.

#### Lobster Salad III

Remove large claws and split a lobster in two lengthwise by beginning the cut on inside of tail end and cutting through entire length of tail and body. Open lobster, remove tail meat, liver, and coral, and set aside. Discard intestinal vein, stomach, and fat, and wipe inside thoroughly with cloth wrung out of cold water. Body meat and small claws are left on shell. Remove meat from upper parts of large claws and cut off (using scissors or can opener) one-half the shell from lower parts, taking out meat and leaving the parts in suitable condition to refill. Cut lobster meat in one-half inch cubes and mix with an equal quantity of finely cut celery. Season with salt, pepper, and vinegar, and moisten with Mayonnaise Dressing. Refill tail, body, and under half of large claw shells. Mix liver and coral, rub through a sieve, add one tablespoon Mayonnaise Dressing and a few drops anchovy essence with enough more Mayonnaise Dressing to cover lobster already in shell. Arrange on a bed of lettuce leaves.
