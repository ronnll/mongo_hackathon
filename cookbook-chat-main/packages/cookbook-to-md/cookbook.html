      “But for life the universe were nothing; and all that has life requires
      nourishment.”
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      With the progress of knowledge the needs of the human body have not been
      forgotten. During the last decade much time has been given by scientists
      to the study of foods and their dietetic value, and it is a subject which
      rightfully should demand much consideration from all. I certainly feel
      that the time is not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of
      diet will be an essential part of one’s education. Then mankind will eat
      to live, will be able to do better mental and physical work, and disease
      will be less frequent.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      At the earnest solicitation of educators, pupils, and friends, I have been
      urged to prepare this book, and I trust it may be a help to many who need
      its aid. It is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a
      compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may awaken an
      interest through its condensed scientific knowledge which will lead to
      deeper thought and broader study of what to eat.

        CHAPTER I: FOOD
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Food is anything which nourishes the body. From fifteen to twenty elements
      enter into the composition of the body, of which the following thirteen
      are considered: oxygen, 62½%; carbon, 21½%; hydrogen, 10%; nitrogen, 3%;
      calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium, magnesium,
      iron, and fluorine the remaining 3%.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Food is necessary for growth, repair, and energy; therefore the elements
      composing the body must be found in the food. The thirteen elements named
      are formed into chemical compounds by the vegetable and animal kingdoms to
      support the highest order of being, man. All food must undergo chemical
      change after being taken into the body, before it can be utilized by the
      body; this is the office of the digestive system.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Food is classified as follows:—</p>

      The chief office of proteids is to build and repair tissues. They furnish
      energy, but at greater cost than carbohydrates, fats, and oils. They
      contain nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur or phosphorus, and
      include all forms of <span class="pageno" id="Page_2">2</span>animal foods
      (excepting fats and glycogen) and some vegetable foods. Examples: milk,
      cheese, eggs, meat, fish, cereals, peas, beans, and lentils. The principal
      constituent of proteid food is albumen. Albumen as found in food takes
      different names, but has the same chemical composition; as,
      <em>albumen</em> in eggs, <em>fibrin</em> in meat, <em>casein</em> in milk
      and cheese, <em>vegetable casein</em> or <em>legumen</em> in peas, beans,
      and lentils; and <em>gluten</em> in wheat. To this same class belongs
      gelatin.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The chief office of the carbohydrates is to furnish energy and maintain
      heat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and include foods
      containing starch and sugar. Examples: vegetables, fruits, cereals,
      sugars, and gums.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The chief office of fats and oils is to store energy and heat to be used
      as needed, and constitute the adipose tissues of the body. Examples:
      butter, cream, fat of meat, fish, cereals, nuts, and the berry of the
      olive-tree.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The chief office of mineral matter is to furnish the necessary salts which
      are found in all animal and vegetable foods. Examples: sodium chloride
      (common salt); carbonates, sulphates and phosphates of sodium, potassium,
      and magnesium; besides calcium phosphates and iron.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Water constitutes about two-thirds the weight of the body, and is in all
      tissues and fluids; therefore its abundant use is necessary. One of the
      greatest errors in diet is neglect to take enough water; while it is found
      in all animal and vegetable food, the amount is insufficient.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">CORRECT PROPORTIONS OF FOOD</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Age, sex, occupation, climate, and season must determine the diet of a
      person in normal condition.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Liquid food (milk or milk in preparation with the various prepared foods
      on the market) should constitute the diet of a child for the first
      eighteen months. After the teeth appear, by which time ferments have been
      developed for the digestion of starchy foods, entire wheat bread, baked
      potatoes, cereals, meat broths, and occasionally boiled eggs may be given.
      If mothers would use Dr. Johnson’s Educators in place of the various sweet
      crackers, children would be as
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>well pleased and better
      nourished; with a glass of milk they form a supper suited to the needs of
      little ones, and experience has shown that children seldom tire of them.
      The diet should be gradually increased by the addition of cooked fruits,
      vegetables, and simple desserts; the third or fourth year fish and meat
      may be introduced, if given sparingly. Always avoid salted meats, coarse
      vegetables (beets, carrots, and turnips), cheese, fried food, pastry, rich
      desserts, confections, condiments, tea, coffee, and iced water. For school
      children the diet should be varied and abundant, constantly bearing in
      mind that this is a period of great mental and physical growth. Where
      children have broken down, supposedly from over-work, the cause has often
      been traced to impoverished diet. It must not be forgotten that digestive
      processes go on so rapidly that the stomach is soon emptied. Thanks to the
      institutor of the school luncheon-counter!

      About one-third of the water is taken in our food, the remainder as a
      beverage. To keep in health and do the best mental and physical work,
      authorities agree that a mixed diet is suited for temperate climates,
      although sound arguments appear from the vegetarian. Women, even though
      they do the same amount of work as men, as a rule require less food. Brain
      workers should take their proteid in a form easily digested. In
      consideration of this fact, fish and eggs form desirable substitutes for
      meat. The working man needs quantity as well as quality, that the stomach
      may have something to act upon. Corned beef, cabbage, brown-bread, and
      pastry, will not overtax his digestion. In old age the digestive organs
      lessen in activity, and the diet should be almost as simple as that of a
      child, increasing the amount of carbohydrates and decreasing the amount of
      proteids and fat. Many diseases which occur after middle life are due to
      eating and drinking such foods as were indulged in during vigorous
      manhood.

      <h3 class="c018">WATER (H<sub>2</sub>O)</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Water is a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid. It is derived from
      five sources,—rains, rivers, surface-water or shallow wells, deep wells,
      and springs. Water is never found pure in nature; it is nearly pure when
      gathered in an open field, after a heavy rainfall, or from springs. For
      town and city supply, surface-water is furnished by some adjacent pond or
      lake. Samples of such water are carefully and frequently analyzed, to make
      sure that it is not polluted with disease germs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The hardness of water depends upon the amount of salts of lime and
      magnesia which it contains. Soft water is free from objectionable salts,
      and is preferable for household purposes. Hard water may be softened by
      boiling, or by the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda
      (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>).
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Water freezes at a temperature of 32° F., boils at 212° F.; when bubbles
      appear on the surface and burst, the boiling-point is reached. In high
      altitudes water boils at a lower temperature. From 32° to 65° F. water is
      termed cold; from 65° to 92° F., tepid; 92° to 100° F., warm; over that
      temperature, hot. Boiled water is freed from all organic impurities, and
      salts of lime are precipitated: it does not ferment, and is a valuable
      antiseptic. Hot water is more stimulating than cold, and is of use taken
      on an empty stomach, while at a temperature of from 60° to 95° F. it is
      used as an emetic; 90° F. being the most favorable temperature.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Distilled water is chemically pure and is always used for medicinal
      purposes. It is flat and insipid to the taste, having been deprived of its
      atmospheric gases.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      There are many charged, carbonated, and mineral spring waters bottled and
      put on the market; many of these are used as agreeable table beverages.
      Examples: Soda Water, Apollinaris, Poland, Seltzer, and Vichy. Some
      contain minerals of medicinal value. Examples: Lithia, saline, and sulphur
      waters.
    </p>
    <div>
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>
      <h3 class="c018">SALTS</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Of all salts found in the body, the most abundant and valuable is sodium
      chloride (NaCl), common salt; it exists in all tissues, secretions, and
      fluids of the body, with the exception of enamel of the teeth. The amount
      found in food is not always sufficient; therefore salt is used as a
      condiment. It assists digestion, inasmuch as it furnishes chlorine for
      hydrochloric acid found in gastric juice.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Common salt is obtained from evaporation of spring and sea-water, also
      from mines. Our supply of salt obtained by evaporation comes chiefly from
      Michigan and New York; mined salt from Louisiana and Kansas.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Salt is a great preservative; advantage is taken of this in salting meat
      and fish.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Other salts—lime, phosphorus, magnesia, potash, sulphur, and iron—are
      obtained in sufficient quantity from food we eat and water we drink. In
      young children, perfect formation of bones and teeth depends upon
      phosphorus and lime taken into the system; these are found in meat and
      fish, but abound in cereals.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">STARCH (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Starch is a white, glistening powder; it is largely distributed throughout
      the vegetable kingdom, being found most abundantly in cereals and
      potatoes. Being a force-producer and heat-giver it forms one of the most
      important foods. Alone it cannot sustain life, but must be taken in
      combination with foods which build and repair tissues.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Test for Starch.</strong> A weak solution of iodine added to cold
      cooked starch gives an intense blue color.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Starch is insoluble in cold water, and soluble to but a small extent in
      boiling water. Cold water separates starch-grains, boiling water causes
      them to swell and burst, thus forming a paste.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Starch subjected to dry heat is changed to <em>dextrine</em>
      (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), British gum. Dextrine
      subjected to heat plus an
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>acid or a ferment is changed to
      <em>dextrose</em> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). Dextrose
      occurs in ripe fruit, honey, sweet wine, and as a manufactured product.
      When grain is allowed to germinate for malting purposes, starch is changed
      to dextrine and dextrose. In fermentation, dextrose is changed to alcohol
      (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>HO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
      Examples: bread making, vinegar, and distilled liquors.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Glycogen, animal starch, is found in many animal tissues and in some
      fungi. Examples: in liver of meat and oysters.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Raw starch is not digestible; consequently all foods containing starch
      should be subjected to boiling water or dry heat, and thoroughly cooked.
      Starch is manufactured from wheat, corn, and potatoes.
      <strong>Corn-starch</strong> is manufactured from Indian corn.
      <strong>Arrowroot</strong>, the purest form of starch, is obtained from
      two or three species of the Maranta plant, which grows in the West Indies
      and other tropical countries. Bermuda arrowroot is most highly esteemed.
      <strong>Tapioca</strong> is starch obtained from tuberous roots of the
      bitter cassava, native of South America. <strong>Sago</strong> is starch
      obtained from sago palms, native of India.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">SUGAR (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Sugar is a crystalline substance, differing from starch by its sweet taste
      and solubility in cold water. As food, its uses are the same as starch;
      all starch must be converted into sugar before it can be assimilated.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The principal kinds of sugar are: cane sugar or <em>sucrose</em>, grape
      sugar or <em>glucose</em> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), milk
      sugar or <em>lactose</em> (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>),
      and fruit sugar or
      <em>levulose</em> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cane sugar</strong> is obtained from sugar cane, beets, and the
      palm and sugar-maple trees. Sugar cane is a grass supposed to be native to
      Southern Asia, but now grown throughout the tropics, a large amount coming
      from Cuba and Louisiana; it is the commonest of all, and in all cases the
      manufacture is essentially the same. The products of manufacture are:
      molasses, syrup, brown sugar, loaf, cut, granulated, powdered, and
      confectioners’ sugar. Brown sugar is cheapest, but is not so pure or sweet
      as white <span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>grades; powdered and
      confectioners’ sugars are fine grades, pulverized, and, although seeming
      less sweet to the taste, are equally pure. Confectioners’ sugar when
      applied to the tongue will dissolve at once; powdered sugar is a little
      granular.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Cane sugar when added to fruits, and allowed to cook for some time,
      changes to grape sugar, losing one-third of its sweetness; therefore the
      reason for adding it when fruit is nearly cooked. Cane sugar is of great
      preservative value, hence its use in preserving fruits and milk; also, for
      the preparation of syrups.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Three changes take place in the cooking of sugar: first, barley sugar;
      second, caramel; third, carbon.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Grape sugar</strong> is found in honey and all sweet fruits. It
      appears on the outside of dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, etc., and
      is only two-thirds as sweet as cane sugar. As a manufactured product it is
      obtained from the starch of corn.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Milk sugar</strong> is obtained from the milk of mammalia, but
      unlike cane sugar does not ferment.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Fruit sugar</strong> is obtained from sweet fruits, and is sold as
      <em>diabetin</em>, is sweeter than cane sugar, and is principally used by
      diabetic patients.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">GUM, PECTOSE, AND CELLULOSE</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      These compounds found in food are closely allied to the carbohydrates, but
      are neither starchy, saccharine, nor oily. Gum exists in the juices of
      almost all plants, coming from the stems, branches, and fruits. Examples:
      gum arabic, gum tragacanth, and mucilage. Pectose exists in the fleshy
      pulp of unripe fruit; during the process of ripening it changes to pectin;
      by cooking, pectin is changed to pectosic acid, and by longer cooking to
      pectic acid. Pectosic acid is jelly-like when cold; pectic acid is
      jelly-like when hot or cold. Cellulose constitutes the cell-walls of
      vegetable life; in very young vegetables it is possible that it can be
      acted upon by the digestive ferments; in older vegetables it becomes woody
      and completely indigestible.
    </p>
    <div>
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>
      <h3 class="c018">FATS AND OILS</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Fats and oils are found in both the animal and vegetable kingdom. Fats are
      solid; oils are liquid; they may be converted into a liquid state by
      application of heat; they contain three substances,—<em>stearin</em>
      (solid), <em>olein</em> (liquid), <em>palmitin</em> (semi-solid). Suet is
      an example where stearin is found in excess; lard, where olein is in
      excess; and butter, where palmitin is in excess. Margarin is a mixture of
      stearin and palmitin. The fatty acids are formed of stearin, olein, and
      palmitin, with glycerine as the base. Examples: stearic, palmitic, and
      oleic acid. Butyric acid is acid found in butter. These are not sour to
      the taste, but are called acids on account of their chemical composition.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Among animal fats cream and butter are of first importance as foods, on
      account of their easy assimilation. Other examples are: the fat of meats,
      bone-marrow, suet (the best found around the loin and kidneys of the beef
      creature), lard, cottolene, coto suet, cocoanut butter, butterine, and
      oleomargarine. The principal animal oils are cod liver oil and oil found
      in the yolk of egg; principal vegetable oils are olive, cottonseed, poppy,
      and cocoanut oils, and oils obtained from various nuts.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Oils are divided into two classes, <em>essential</em> and <em>fixed</em>.
      Essential oils are volatile and soluble in alcohol. Examples: clove, rose,
      nutmeg, and violet. Fixed oils are non-volatile and soluble in ether, oil,
      or turpentine. Examples: oil of nuts, corn meal, and mustard.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fats may be heated to a high temperature, as considered in cookery they
      have no boiling-point. When appearing to boil, it is evident water has
      been added, and the temperature lowered to that of boiling water, 212° F.

      The value of milk as a food is obvious from the fact that it constitutes
      the natural food of all young mammalia during the period of their most
      rapid growth. There is some danger, however, of overestimating its value
      in the dietary of adults, as solid food is essential, and liquid taken
      should act as a stimulant and a solvent rather than as a nutrient. One
      obtains the greatest benefit from milk when taken alone at regular
      intervals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped, rather than
      drunk. Hot milk is often given to produce sleep.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the globules of fat, which
      have been held in suspension throughout the liquid, rise to the top in the
      form of <em>cream</em>; this is due to their lower specific gravity.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The difference in quality of milk depends chiefly on the quantity of fat
      therein: casein, lactose, and mineral matter being nearly constant, water
      varying but little unless milk is adulterated.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Why Milk Sours.</strong> A germ found floating in the air attacks
      a portion of the lactose in the milk, converting it into lactic acid;
      this, in turn, acts upon the casein (proteid) and precipitates it,
      producing what is known as <em>curd</em> and <em>whey</em>. Whey contains
      water, salts, and some sugar.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Milk is preserved by sterilization, pasteurization, and evaporation.
      <em>Fresh condensed milk</em>, a form of evaporized milk, is sold in bulk,
      and is preferred by many to serve with coffee. Various brands of condensed
      milk and cream are on the market in tin cans, hermetically sealed.
      Examples: Nestle’s Swiss Condensed Milk, Eagle Condensed Milk, Daisy
      Condensed Milk, Highland Evaporated Cream, Borden’s Peerless Evaporated
      Cream. <em>Malted milk</em>—evaporized milk in combination
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>with extracts of malted barley
      and wheat—is used to a considerable extent; it is sold in the form of
      powder.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Thin, or strawberry, and thick cream may be obtained from almost all
      creameries. Devonshire, or clotted cream, is cream which has been removed
      from milk allowed to heat slowly to a temperature of about 150° F.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In feeding infants with milk, sterilization or pasteurization is sometimes
      recommended to avoid danger of infectious germs. By this process milk can
      be kept for many days, and transported if necessary. To prevent acidity of
      the stomach, add from one to two teaspoonfuls of lime water to each
      half-pint of milk. Lime water may be bought at any druggist’s, or easily
      prepared at home.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Lime Water.</strong> Pour two quarts boiling water over an inch
      cube unslacked lime; stir thoroughly and stand over night; in the morning
      pour off the liquid that is clear, and bottle for use. Keep in a cool
      place.

      Butter of commerce is made from cream of cow’s milk. The quality depends
      upon the breed of cow, manner of, and care in, feeding. Milk from Jersey
      and Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of butter.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Butter should be kept in a cool place and well covered, otherwise it is
      liable to become rancid; this is due to the albuminous constituents of the
      milk, acting as a ferment, setting free the fatty acids. First-quality
      butter should be used; this does not include pat butter or fancy grades.
      Poor butter has not been as thoroughly worked during manufacture,
      consequently more casein remains; therefore it is more apt to become
      rancid. Fresh butter spoils quickly; salt acts as a preservative. Butter
      which has become rancid by too long keeping may be greatly improved by
      melting, <span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>heating, and quickly
      chilling with ice-water. The butter will rise to the top, and may be
      easily removed.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Where butter cannot be afforded, there are several products on the market
      which have the same chemical composition as butter, and are equally
      wholesome. Examples: butterine and oleomargarine.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Buttermilk is liquid remaining after butter “has come.” When taken fresh,
      it makes a wholesome beverage.

      Cheese is the solid part of sweet milk obtained by heating milk and
      coagulating it by means of rennet or an acid. Rennet is an infusion made
      from prepared inner membrane of the fourth stomach of the calf. The curd
      is salted and subjected to pressure. Cheese is made from skim milk, milk
      plus cream, or cream. Cheese is kept for a longer or shorter time,
      according to the kind, that fermentation or decomposition may take place.
      This is called ripening. Some cream cheeses are not allowed to ripen. Milk
      from Jersey and Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of cheese.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Cheese is very valuable food; being rich in proteid, it may be used as a
      substitute for meat. A pound of cheese is equal in proteid to two pounds
      of beef. Cheese in the raw state is difficult of digestion. This is
      somewhat overcome by cooking and adding a small amount of bicarbonate of
      soda. A small piece of rich cheese is often eaten to assist digestion.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The various brands of cheese take their names from the places where made.
      Many foreign ones are now well imitated in this country. The favorite
      kinds of skim-milk cheese are: Edam, Gruyère, and Parmesan. Parmesan is
      very hard and used principally for grating. The holes in Gruyère are due
      to aeration.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The favorite kinds of milk cheese are: Gloucester, Cheshire,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>Cheddar, and Gorgonzola; Milk
      and Cream cheese: Stilton and Double Gloucester; Cream cheese: Brie,
      Neufchâtel, and Camembert.

    <h3 class="c018">FRUITS</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The varieties of fruits consumed are numerous, and their uses important.
      They are chiefly valuable for their sugar, acids, and salts, and are
      cooling, refreshing, and stimulating. They act as a tonic, and assist in
      purifying the blood. Many contain a jelly-like substance, called pectin,
      and several contain starch, which during the ripening process is converted
      into glucose. Bananas, dates, figs, prunes, and grapes, owing to their
      large amount of sugar, are the most nutritious. Melons, oranges, lemons,
      and grapes contain the largest amount of water. Apples, lemons, and
      oranges are valuable for their potash salts, and oranges and lemons
      especially valuable for their citric acid. It is of importance to those
      who are obliged to exclude much sugar from their dietary, to know that
      plums, peaches, apricots, and raspberries have less sugar than other
      fruits; apples, sweet cherries, grapes, and pears contain the largest
      amount. Apples are obtainable nearly all the year, and on account of their
      variety, cheapness, and abundance, are termed queen of fruits.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Thoroughly ripe fruits should be freely indulged in, and to many are more
      acceptable than desserts prepared in the kitchen. If possible, fruits
      should always appear on the breakfast-table. In cases where uncooked fruit
      cannot be freely eaten, many kinds may be cooked and prove valuable. Never
      eat unripe fruit, or that which is beginning to decay. Fruits should be
      wiped or rinsed before serving.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">VEGETABLE ACIDS, AND WHERE FOUND</h3>
    <p class="c019">The principal vegetable acids are:</p>
    <p class="c009">
      I. Acetic (HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), found in wine and
      vinegar.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      II. Tartaric (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), found
      in grapes, pineapples, and tamarinds.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      III. Malic, much like tartaric, found in apples, pears, peaches, apricots,
      gooseberries, and currants.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>IV. Citric
      (H<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), found in lemons,
      oranges, limes, and citron.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      V. Oxalic (H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), found in rhubarb and
      sorrel.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      To these may be added tannic acid, obtained from gall nuts. Some fruits
      contain two or more acids. Malic and citric are found in strawberries,
      raspberries, gooseberries, and cherries; malic, citric, and oxalic in
      cranberries.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">CONDIMENTS</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Condiments are not classed among foods, but are known as food adjuncts.
      They are used to stimulate the appetite by adding flavor to food. Among
      the most important are salt, spices, and various flavorings. Salt,
      according to some authorities, is called a food, being necessary to life.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Black pepper</strong> is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns are the
      dried berries of <em>Piper nigrum</em>, grown in the West Indies, Sumatra,
      and other eastern countries.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>White pepper</strong> is made from the same berry, the outer husk
      being removed before grinding. It is less irritating than black pepper to
      the coating of the stomach.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cayenne pepper</strong> is the powdered pod of
      <em>Capsicum</em> grown on the eastern coast of Africa and in Zanzibar.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Mustard</strong> is the ground seed of two species of the
      Brassica. <em>Brassica alba</em> yields white mustard seeds;
      <em>Brassica nigra</em>, black mustard seeds. Both species are grown in
      Europe and America.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Ginger</strong> is the pulverized dried root of
      <em>Zanzibar officinale</em>, grown in Jamaica, China, and India.
      Commercially speaking, there are three grades,—Jamaica, best and
      strongest; Cochin, and African.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cinnamon</strong> is the ground inner bark of
      <em>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</em>, principally grown in Ceylon. The cinnamon
      of commerce (cassia) is the powdered bark of different species of the same
      shrub, which is principally grown in China, and called Chinese cinnamon.
      It is cheaper than true cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Clove</strong> is the ground flower buds of
      <em>Caryophyllus aromaticus</em>, native to the Moluccas or Spice Islands,
      but now grown principally in Zanzibar, Pemba, and the West Indies.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span

      <strong>Mace.</strong> The fibrous network which envelops the nutmeg seed
      constitutes the mace of commerce.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Vinegar</strong> is made from apple cider, malt, and wine, and is
      the product of fermentation. It is a great preservative; hence its use in
      the making of pickles, sauces, and other condiments. The amount of acetic
      acid in vinegar varies from two to seven per cent.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Capers</strong> are flower buds of <em>Capparis spinosa</em>,
      grown in countries bordering the Mediterranean. They are preserved in
      vinegar, and bottled for importation.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Horseradish</strong> is the root of
      <em>Cochliaria armoracia</em>,—a plant native to Europe, but now grown in

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">FLAVORING EXTRACTS</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Many flavoring extracts are on the market. Examples: almond, vanilla,
      lemon, orange, peach, and rose. These are made from the flower, fruit, or
      seed from which they are named. Strawberry, pineapple, and banana extracts
      are manufactured from chemicals.

        CHAPTER II: COOKERY</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Cookery is the art of preparing food for the nourishment of the body.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Prehistoric man may have lived on uncooked foods, but there are no savage
      races to-day who do not practise cookery in some way, however crude.
      Progress in civilization has been accompanied by progress in cookery.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Much time has been given in the last few years to the study of foods,
      their necessary proportions, and manner of cooking them. Educators have
      been shown by scientists that this knowledge should be disseminated; as a
      result, “Cookery” is found in the curriculum of public schools of many of
      our towns and cities.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Food is cooked to develop new flavors, to make it more palatable and
      digestible, and to destroy micro-organisms. For cooking there are three
      essentials (besides the material to be cooked),—heat, air, and moisture.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Heat</strong> is molecular motion, and is produced by combustion.
      Heat used for cookery is obtained by the combustion of inflammable
      substances—wood, coal, charcoal, coke, gas, gasoline, kerosene, and
      alcohol—called fuels. Heat for cookery is applied by radiation,
      conduction, and convection.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Air</strong> is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and
      surrounds everything. Combustion cannot take place without it, the oxygen
      of the air being the only supporter of combustion.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Moisture</strong>, in the form of water, either found in the food
      or added to it.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and bursts starch-grains;
      hardens albumen in eggs, fish, and meat; softens fibrous portions of meat,
      and cellulose of vegetables.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>Among fuels, kerosene oil is
      the cheapest; gas gives the greatest amount of heat in the shortest time.
      <em>Soft wood</em>, like pine, on account of its coarse fibre, burns
      quickly; therefore makes the best kindling. <em>Hard wood</em>, like oak
      and ash, having the fibres closely packed, burns slowly, and is used in
      addition to pine wood for kindling coal. Where only wood is used as a
      fuel, it is principally hard wood.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Charcoal</em> for fuel is produced by the smothered combustion of
      wood. It gives an intense, even heat, therefore makes a good broiling
      fire. Its use for kindling is not infrequent.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      There are two kinds of coal: <em>Anthracite</em>, or <em>hard coal</em>.
      Examples: Hard and free-burning White Ash, Shamokin, and Franklin. Nut is
      any kind of hard coal obtained from screenings. <em>Bituminous</em>, or
      <em>soft coal</em>. Example: cannel coal.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Coke</em> is the solid product of carbonized coal, and bears the same
      relation to coal that charcoal bears to wood.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Alcohol</em> is employed as fuel when the chafing-dish is used.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">FIRE</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Fire for cookery is confined in a stove or range, so that heat may be
      utilized and regulated. Flame-heat is obtained from kerosene, gas, or
      alcohol, as used in oil-stoves, gas-stoves or gas-ranges, and
      chafing-dishes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>A cooking-stove</strong> is a large iron box set on legs. It has a
      fire-box in the front, the sides of which are lined with fireproof
      material similar to that of which bricks are made. The bottom is furnished
      with a movable iron grate. Underneath the fire-box is a space which
      extends from the grate to a pan for receiving ashes. At the back of
      fire-box is a compartment called the oven, accessible on each side of the
      stove by a door. Between the oven and the top of the stove is a space for
      the circulation of air.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Stoves are connected with chimney-flues by means of a stovepipe, and have
      dampers to regulate the supply of air and heat, and as an outlet for smoke
      and gases.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The damper below the fire-box is known as the <em>front damper</em>, by
      means of which the air supply is regulated, thus regulating the heat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>The oven is heated by a
      circulation of hot air. This is accomplished by closing the
      <em>oven-damper</em>, which is situated near the oven. When this damper is
      left open, the hot air rushes up the chimney. The damper near the chimney
      is known as the <em>chimney-damper</em>. When open it gives a free outlet
      for the escape of smoke and gas. When partially closed, as is usually the
      case in most ranges, except when the fire is started, it serves as a saver
      of heat. There is also a <em>check</em>, which, when open, cools the fire
      and saves heat, but should always be closed except when used for this
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Stoves are but seldom used, portable ranges having taken their places.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>A portable range</strong> is a cooking-stove with one oven door;
      it often has an under oven, of use for warming dishes and keeping food
      hot.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>A set range</strong> is built in a fireplace. It usually has two
      ovens, one on each side of the fire-box, or two above it at the back. Set
      ranges, as they consume so large an amount of fuel, are being replaced by
      portable ones.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">HOW TO BUILD A FIRE</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Before starting to build a fire, free the grate from ashes. To do this,
      put on covers, close front and back dampers, and open oven-damper; turn
      grate, and ashes will fall into the ash receiver. If these rules are not
      followed, ashes will fly over the room. Turn grate back into place, remove
      the covers over fire-box, and cover grate with pieces of paper (twisted in
      centre and left loose at the ends). Cover paper with small sticks, or
      pieces of pine wood, being sure that the wood reaches the ends of
      fire-box, and so arranged that it will admit air. Over pine wood arrange
      hard wood; then sprinkle with two shovelfuls of coal. Put on covers, open
      closed dampers, strike a match,—sufficient friction is formed to burn the
      phosphorus, this in turn lights the sulphur, and the sulphur the
      wood,—then apply the lighted match under the grate, and you have a fire.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Now blacken the stove. Begin at front of range, and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>work towards the back; as the
      iron heats, a good polish may be obtained. When the wood is thoroughly
      kindled, add more coal. A blue flame will soon appear, which is the gas
      (CO) in the coal burning to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), when the blue
      flame changes to a white flame; then the oven-damper should be closed. In
      a few moments the front damper may be nearly closed, leaving space to
      admit sufficient oxygen to feed the fire. It is sometimes forgotten that
      oxygen is necessary to keep a fire burning. As soon as the coal is well
      ignited, half close the chimney-damper, unless the draft be very poor.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Never allow the fire-box to be more than three-fourths filled. When full,
      the draft is checked, a larger amount of fuel is consumed, and much heat
      is lost. This is a point that should be impressed on the mind of the cook.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Ashes must be removed and sifted daily; pick over and save good
      coals,—which are known as cinders,—throwing out useless pieces, known as
      clinkers.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      If a fire is used constantly during the day, replenish coal frequently,
      but in small quantities. If for any length of time the fire is not needed,
      open check, the dampers being closed; when again wanted for use, close
      check, open front damper, and with a poker rake out ashes from under fire,
      and wait for fire to burn brightly before adding new coal.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Coal when red hot has parted with most of its heat. Some refuse to believe
      this, and insist upon keeping dampers open until most of the heat has
      escaped into the chimney.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      To keep a fire over night, remove the ashes from under the fire, put on
      enough coal to fill the box, close the dampers, and lift the back covers
      enough to admit air. This is better than lifting the covers over the
      fire-box and prevents poisonous gases entering the room.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">WAYS OF COOKING</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, stewing, roasting,
      baking, frying, sautéing, braising, and fricasseeing.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Boiling</strong> is cooking in boiling water. Solid food so cooked
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>is called boiled food, though
      literally this expression is incorrect. Examples: boiled eggs, potatoes,
      mutton, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Water boils at 212° F. (sea level), and simmers at 185° F. Slowly boiling
      water has the same temperature as rapidly boiling water, consequently is
      able to do the same work,—a fact often forgotten by the cook, who is too
      apt “to wood” the fire that water may boil vigorously.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Watery vapor and steam pass off from boiling water. Steam is invisible;
      watery vapor is visible, and is often miscalled steam. Cooking utensils
      commonly used admit the escape of watery vapor and steam; thereby much
      heat is lost if food is cooked in rapidly boiling water.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Water is boiled for two purposes: first, cooking of itself to destroy
      organic impurities; second, for cooking foods. Boiling water toughens and
      hardens albumen in eggs; toughens fibrin and dissolves tissues in meat;
      bursts starch-grains and softens cellulose in cereals and vegetables. Milk
      should never be allowed to boil. At boiling temperature (214° F.) the
      casein is slightly hardened, and the fat is rendered more difficult of
      digestion. Milk heated over boiling water, as in a double boiler, is
      called <em>scalded milk</em>, and reaches a temperature of 196° F. When
      foods are cooked over hot water the process is called steaming.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Stewing</strong> is cooking in a small amount of hot water for a
      long time at low temperature; it is the most economical way of cooking
      meats, as all nutriment is retained, and the ordinary way of cooking
      cheaper cuts. Thus fibre and connective tissues are softened, and the
      whole is made tender and palatable.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Broiling</strong> is cooking over or in front of a clear fire. The
      food to be cooked is usually placed in a greased broiler or on a gridiron
      held near the coals, turned often at first to sear the outside,—thus
      preventing escape of inner juices,—afterwards turned occasionally. Tender
      meats and fish may be cooked in this way. The flavor obtained by broiling
      is particularly fine; there is, however, a greater loss of weight in this
      than in any other way of cooking, as the food thus cooked is exposed to
      free circulation of air. When coal is not used, or a fire is not in
      condition for broiling, a plan for
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span><em>pan broiling</em> has been
      adopted. This is done by placing food to be cooked in a hissing hot
      frying-pan, turning often as in broiling.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Roasting</strong> is cooking before a clear fire, with a reflector
      to concentrate the heat. Heat is applied in the same way as for broiling,
      the difference being that the meat for roasting is placed on a spit and
      allowed to revolve, thicker pieces alway being employed. Tin-kitchens are
      now but seldom used. Meats cooked in a range oven, though really baked,
      are said to be roasted. Meats so cooked are pleasing to the sight and
      agreeable to the palate, although, according to Edward Atkinson, not so
      easily digested as when cooked at a lower temperature in the Aladdin oven.
    </p>
    <p class="c009"><strong>Baking</strong> is cooking in a range oven.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Frying</strong> is cooking by means of immersion in deep fat
      raised to a temperature of 350° to 400° F. For frying purposes olive oil,
      lard, beef drippings, cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut butter are used.
      A combination of two-thirds lard and one-third beef suet (tried out and
      clarified) is better than lard alone. Cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut
      butter are economical, inasmuch as they may be heated to a high
      temperature without discoloring, therefore may be used for a larger number
      of fryings. Cod fat obtained from beef is often used by <em>chefs</em> for
      frying.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Great care should be taken in frying that fat is of the right temperature;
      otherwise food so cooked will absorb fat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Nearly all foods which do not contain eggs are dipped in flour or crumbs,
      egg, and crumbs, before frying. The intense heat of fat hardens the
      albumen, thus forming a coating which prevents food from “soaking fat.”
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When meat or fish is to be fried, it should be kept in a warm room for
      some time previous to cooking, and wiped as dry as possible. If cold, it
      decreases the temperature of the fat to such extent that a coating is not
      formed quickly enough to prevent fat from penetrating the food. The
      ebullition of fat is due to water found in food to be cooked.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Great care must be taken that too much is not put into
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>the fat at one time, not only
      because it lowers the temperature of the fat, but because it causes it to
      bubble and go over the sides of the kettle. It is not fat that boils, but
      water which fat has received from food.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      All fried food on removal from fat should be drained on brown paper.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Rules for Testing Fat for Frying.</strong> 1. When the fat begins
      to smoke, drop in an inch cube of bread from soft part of loaf, and if in
      forty seconds it is golden brown, the fat is then of right temperature for
      frying any cooked mixture.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      2. Use same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one minute for bread to
      brown.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat; new fat should be used
      for batter and dough mixtures, potatoes, and fishballs; after these, fish,
      meat, and croquettes. Fat should be frequently clarified.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Clarify Fat.</strong> Melt fat, add raw potato cut in
      quarter-inch slices, and allow fat to heat gradually; when fat ceases to
      bubble and potatoes are well browned, strain through double cheese-cloth,
      placed over wire strainer, into a pan. The potato absorbs any odors or
      gases, and collects to itself some of the sediment, remainder settling to
      bottom of kettle.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When small amount of fat is to be clarified, add to cold fat boiling
      water, stir vigorously, and set aside to cool; the fat will form a cake on
      top, which may be easily removed; on bottom of the cake will be found
      sediment, which may be readily scraped off with a knife.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Remnants of fat, either cooked or uncooked, should be saved and tried out,
      and when necessary clarified.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fat from beef, poultry, chicken, and pork, may be used for shortening or
      frying purposes; fat from mutton and smoked meats may be used for making
      hard and soft soap; fat removed from soup stock, the water in which corned
      beef has been cooked, and drippings from roast beef, may be tried out,
      clarified, and used for shortening or frying purposes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Try out Fat.</strong> Cut in small pieces and melt in top of
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>a double boiler; in this way it
      will require less watching than if placed in kettle on the back of range.
      Leaf lard is tried out in the same way; in cutting the leaf, remove
      membrane. After straining lard, that which remains may be salted, pressed,
      and eaten as a relish, and is called scraps.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Sautéing</strong> is frying in a small quantity of fat. Food so
      cooked is much more difficult of digestion than when fried in deep fat; it
      is impossible to cook in this way without the food absorbing fat. A
      frying-pan or griddle is used; the food is cooked on one side, then
      turned, and cooked on the other.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Braising</strong> is stewing and baking (meat). Meat to be braised
      is frequently first sautéd to prevent escape of much juice in the gravy.
      The meat is placed in a pan with a small quantity of stock or water,
      vegetables (carrot, turnip, celery, and onion) cut in pieces, salt,
      pepper, and sweet herbs. The pan should have a tight-fitting cover. Meat
      so prepared should be cooked in an oven at low uniform temperature for a
      long time. This is an economical way of cooking, and the only way besides
      stewing or boiling of making a large piece of tough meat palatable and
      digestible.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Fricasseeing</strong> is sautéing and serving with a sauce. Tender
      meat is fricasseed without previous cooking; less tender meat requires
      cooking in hot water before fricasseeing. Although veal is obtained from a
      young creature, it requires long cooking; it is usually sautéd, and then
      cooked in a sauce at low temperature for a long time.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">VARIOUS WAYS OF PREPARING FOOD FOR COOKING</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      <strong>Egging and Crumbing.</strong> Use for crumbing dried bread crumbs
      which have been rolled and sifted, or soft stale bread broken in pieces
      and forced through a colander. An ingenious machine on the market, “The
      Bread Crumber,” does this work. Egg used for crumbing should be broken
      into a shallow plate and beaten with a silver fork to blend yolk and
      white; dilute each egg with two tablespoons
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>water. The crumbs should be
      taken on a board; food to be fried should be first rolled in crumbs (care
      being taken that all parts are covered with crumbs), then dipped in egg
      mixture (equal care being taken to cover all parts), then rolled in crumbs
      again; after the last crumbing remove food to a place on the board where
      there are no crumbs, and shake off some of the outer ones which make
      coating too thick. A broad-bladed knife with short handle—the Teller
      knife—is the most convenient utensil for lifting food to be crumbed from
      egg mixture. Small scallops, oysters, and crabs are more easily crumbed by
      putting crumbs and fish in paper and shaking paper until the fish is
      covered with crumbs. The object of first crumbing is to dry the surface
      that egg may cling to it; and where a thin coating is desired flour is
      often used in place of crumbs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Larding</strong> is introducing small pieces of fat salt pork or
      bacon through the surface of uncooked meat. The flavor of lean and dry
      meat is much improved by larding; tenderloin of beef (fillet), grouse,
      partridge, pigeon, and liver are often prepared in this way. Pig pork
      being firm, is best for larding. Pork should be kept in a cold place that
      it may be well chilled. Remove rind and use the part of pork which lies
      between rind and vein. With sharp knife (which is sure to make a clean
      cut) remove slices a little less than one-fourth inch thick; cut the
      slices into strips a little less than one-fourth inch wide; these strips
      should be two and one-fourth inches long, and are called
      <em>lardoons</em>. Lardoons for small birds—quail, for example—should be
      cut smaller and not quite so long. To lard, insert one end of lardoon into
      larding-needle, hold needle firmly, and with pointed end take up a stitch
      one-third inch deep and three-fourths inch wide; draw needle through, care
      being taken that lardoon is left in meat and its ends project to equal
      lengths. Arrange lardoons in parallel rows, one inch apart, stitches in
      the alternate rows being directly underneath each other. Lard the upper
      surface of cuts of meat with the grain, never across it. In birds, insert
      lardoons at right angles to breastbone on either side. When large lardoons
      are forced through meat from surface to surface, the process is called
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>daubing. Example: Beef à la
      mode. Thin slices of fat salt pork placed over meat may be substituted for
      larding, but flavor is not the same as when pork is drawn through flesh,
      and the dish is far less sightly.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Boning</strong> is removing bones from meat or fish, leaving the
      flesh nearly in its original shape. For boning, a small sharp knife with
      pointed blade is essential. Legs of mutton and veal and loins of beef may
      be ordered boned at market, no extra charge being made.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Whoever wishes to learn how to bone should first be taught boning of a
      small bird; when this is accomplished, larger birds, chickens, and turkeys
      may easily be done, the processes varying but little. In large birds
      tendons are drawn from legs, and the wings are left on and boned.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">How to Bone a Bird</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      In buying birds for boning, select those which have been fresh killed, dry
      picked, and not drawn. Singe, remove pinfeathers, head, and feet, and cut
      off wings close to body. Lay bird on a board, breast down.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the skin the entire length
      of body. Scrape the flesh from backbone until end of one shoulder-blade is
      found; scrape flesh from shoulder-blade and continue around wing joint,
      cutting through tendinous portions which are encountered; then bone other
      side. Scrape skin from backbone the entire length of body, working across
      the ribs. Free wishbone and collar-bones, at same time removing crop and
      windpipe; continue down breastbone, particular care being taken not to
      break the skin as it lies very near bone, or to cut the delicate membranes
      which enclose entrails. Scrape flesh from second joints and drumsticks,
      laying it back and drawing off as a glove may be drawn from the hand.
      Withdraw carcass and put flesh back in its original shape. In large birds
      where wings are boned, scrape flesh to middle joint, where bone should be
      broken, leaving bone at tip end to assist in preserving shape.

      <h4 class="c021">How to Measure</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure the best results.
      Good judgment, with experience, has taught some to measure by sight; but
      the majority need definite guides.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Tin, granite-ware, and glass measuring cups, divided in quarters or
      thirds, holding one half-pint, and tea and table spoons of regulation
      sizes,—which may be bought at any store where kitchen furnishings are
      sold,—and a case knife, are essentials for correct measurement.
      Mixing-spoons, which are little larger than tablespoons, should not be
      confounded with the latter.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Measuring Ingredients.</strong> Flour, meal, powdered and
      confectioners’ sugar, and soda should be sifted before measuring. Mustard
      and baking-powder, from standing in boxes, settle, therefore should be
      stirred to lighten; salt frequently lumps, and these lumps should be
      broken. A <em>cupful</em> is measured level. To measure a cupful, put in
      the ingredient by spoonfuls or from a scoop, round slightly, and level
      with a case knife, care being taken not to shake the cup.
      <em
        >A tablespoonful is measured level. A teaspoonful is measured level.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      To measure tea or table spoonfuls, dip the spoon in the ingredient, fill,
      lift, and level with a knife, the sharp edge of knife being toward tip of
      spoon. Divide with knife lengthwise of spoon, for a half-spoonful; divide
      halves crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. Less
      than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is considered a few grains.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Measuring Liquids.</strong> A cupful of liquid is all the cup will
      hold.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">A tea or table spoonful is all the spoon will hold.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Measuring Butter, Lard, etc.</strong> To measure butter, lard, and
      other solid fats, pack solidly into cup or spoon, and level with a knife.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for in the same recipe,
      measure in the order given, thereby using but one cup.

      <h4 class="c021">How to Combine Ingredients</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Next to measuring comes care in combining,—a fact not always recognized by
      the inexperienced. Three ways are considered,—stirring, beating, and
      cutting and folding.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To stir</strong>, mix by using circular motion, widening the
      circles until all is blended. Stirring is the motion ordinarily employed
      in all cookery, alone or in combination with beating.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To beat</strong>, turn ingredient or ingredients over and over,
      continually bringing the under part to the surface, thus allowing the
      utensil used for beating to be constantly brought in contact with bottom
      of the dish and throughout the mixture.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To cut and fold</strong>, introduce one ingredient into another
      ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a spoon, a repeated vertical
      downward motion, known as cutting; and a turning over and over of mixture,
      allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact with bottom of dish,
      is called folding. These repeated motions are alternated until thorough
      blending is accomplished.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>By stirring</strong>, ingredients are mixed; <em>by beating</em>,
      a large amount of air is enclosed; <em>by cutting and folding</em>, air
      already introduced is prevented from escaping.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Ways of Preserving</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      1. <strong>By Freezing.</strong> Foods which spoil readily are frozen for
      transportation, and must be kept packed in ice until used. Examples: Fish
      and poultry.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      2. <strong>By Refrigeration.</strong> Foods so preserved are kept in cold
      storage. The cooling is accomplished by means of ice, or by a machine
      where compressed gas is cooled and then permitted to expand. Examples:
      meat, milk, butter, eggs, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      3. <strong>By Canning.</strong> Which is preserving in air-tight glass
      jars, or tin cans hermetically sealed. When fruit is canned, sugar is
      usually added.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      4. <strong>By Sugar.</strong> Examples: fruit juices and condensed milk.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      5. <strong>By Exclusion of Air.</strong> Foods are preserved by exclusion
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>of air in other ways than
      canning. Examples: grapes in bran, eggs in lime water, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      6. <strong>By Drying.</strong> Drying consists in evaporation of nearly
      all moisture, and is generally combined with salting, except in vegetables
      and fruits.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      7. <strong>By Evaporation.</strong> There are examples where considerable
      moisture remains, though much is driven off. Example: beef extract.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      8. <strong>By Salting.</strong> There are two kinds of salting,—dry, and
      corning or salting in brine. Examples: salt codfish, beef, pork, tripe,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      9. <strong>By Smoking.</strong> Some foods, after being salted, are hung
      in a closed room for several hours, where hickory wood is allowed to
      smother. Examples: ham, beef, and fish.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      10. <strong>By Pickling.</strong> Vinegar, to which salt is added, and
      sometimes sugar and spices, is scalded; and cucumbers, onions, and various
      kinds of fruit are allowed to remain in it.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      11. <strong>By Oil.</strong> Examples: sardines, anchovies, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      12. <strong>By Antiseptics.</strong> The least wholesome way is by the use
      of antiseptics. Borax and salicylic acid, when employed, should be used
      sparingly.

    <h3 class="c018">TEA</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Tea is used by more than one-half the human race; and, although the United
      States is not a tea-drinking country, one and one-half pounds are consumed
      per capita per annum.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      All tea is grown from one species of shrub, <em>Thea</em>, the leaves of
      which constitute the tea of commerce. Climate, elevation, soil,
      cultivation, and care in picking and curing all go to make up the
      differences. First-quality tea is made from young, whole leaves. Two kinds
      of tea are considered:—
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Black tea</em>, made from leaves which have been allowed to ferment
      before curing.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Green tea</em>, made from unfermented leaves artificially colored.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>The best black tea comes from
      India and Ceylon. Some familiar brands are Oolong, Formosa, English
      Breakfast, Orange Pekoe, and Flowery Pekoe. The last two named, often
      employed at the “five o’clock tea,” command high prices; they are made
      from the youngest leaves. Orange Pekoe is scented with orange leaves. The
      best green tea comes from Japan. Some familiar brands are Hyson, Japan,
      and Gunpowder.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      From analysis, it has been found that tea is rich in proteid, but taken as
      an infusion acts as a stimulant rather than as a nutrient. The nutriment
      is gained from sugar and milk served with it. The stimulating property of
      tea is due to the alkaloid, <em>theine</em>, together with an essential
      oil; it contains an astringent, tannin. Black tea contains less theine,
      essential oil, and tannin than green tea. The tannic acid, developed from
      the tannin by infusion, injures the coating of the stomach.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Although tea is not a substitute for food, it appears so for a
      considerable period of time, as its stimulating effect is immediate. It is
      certain that less food is required where much tea is taken, for by its use
      there is less wear of the tissues, consequently need of repair. When taken
      to excess, it so acts on the nervous system as to produce sleeplessness or
      insomnia, and finally makes a complete wreck of its victim. Taken in
      moderation, it acts as a mild stimulant, and ingests a considerable amount
      of water into the system; it heats the body in winter, and cools the body
      in summer. Children should never be allowed to drink tea, and it had
      better be avoided by the young, while it may be indulged in by the aged,
      as it proves a valuable stimulant as the functional activities of the
      stomach become weakened.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Freshly boiled water should be used for making tea. Boiled, because below
      the boiling-point the stimulating property, theine, would not be
      extracted. Freshly boiled, because long cooking renders it flat and
      insipid to taste on account of escape of its atmospheric gases. Tea should
      always be infused, never boiled. Long steeping destroys the delicate
      flavor by developing a larger amount of tannic acid.

    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      The coffee-tree is native to Abyssinia, but is now grown in all tropical
      countries. It belongs to the genus <em>Coffea</em>, of which there are
      about twenty-two species. The seeds of berries of coffee-trees constitute
      the coffee of commerce. Each berry contains two seeds, with exception of
      maleberry, which is a single round seed. In their natural state they are
      almost tasteless; therefore color, shape, and size determine value.
      Formerly, coffee was cured by exposure to the sun; but on account of warm
      climate and sudden rainfalls, coffee was often injured. By the new method
      coffee is washed, and then dried by steam heat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In coffee plantations, trees are planted in parallel rows, from six to
      eight feet apart, and are pruned so as never to exceed six feet in height.
      Banana-trees are often grown in coffee plantations, advantage being taken
      of their outspreading leaves, which protect coffee-trees from direct rays
      of the sun. Brazil produces about two-thirds the coffee used. Central
      America, Java, and Arabia are also coffee centres.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Tea comes to us ready for use; coffee needs roasting. In process of
      roasting the seeds increase in size, but lose fifteen per cent in weight.
      Roasting is necessary to develop the delightful aroma and flavor. Java
      coffee is considered finest. Mocha commands a higher price, owing to
      certain acidity and sparkle, which alone is not desirable; but when
      combined with Java, in proportion of two parts Java to one part Mocha, the
      coffee best suited to average taste is made. Some people prefer Maleberry
      Java; so especial care is taken to have maleberries separated, that they
      may be sold for higher price. Old Government Java has deservedly gained a
      good reputation, as it is carefully inspected, and its sale controlled by
      Dutch government. Strange as it may seem to the consumer, all coffee sold
      as Java does not come from the island of Java. Any coffee, wherever grown,
      having same characteristics and flavor, is sold as Java. The same is true
      of other kinds of coffee.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alkaloid
      <em>caffeine</em>, together with an essential oil. Like tea, it contains
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>an astringent. Coffee is more
      stimulating than tea, although, weight for weight, tea contains about
      twice as much <em>theine</em> as coffee contains <em>caffeine</em>. The
      smaller proportion of tea used accounts for the difference. A cup of
      coffee with breakfast, and a cup of tea with supper, serve as a mild
      stimulant for an adult, and form a valuable food adjunct, but should never
      be found in the dietary of a child or dyspeptic. Coffee taken in
      moderation quickens action of the heart, acts directly upon the nervous
      system, and assists gastric digestion. Fatigue of body and mind are much
      lessened by moderate use of coffee; severe exposure to cold can be better
      endured by the coffee drinker. In times of war, coffee has proved more
      valuable than alcoholic stimulants to keep up the enduring power of
      soldiers. Coffee acts as an antidote for opium and alcoholic poisoning.
      Tea and coffee are much more readily absorbed when taken on an empty
      stomach; therefore this should be avoided except when used for medicinal
      purposes. Coffee must be taken in moderation; its excessive use means
      palpitation of the heart, tremor, insomnia, and nervous prostration.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Coffee is often adulterated with chiccory, beans, peas, and various
      cereals, which are colored, roasted, and ground. By many, a small amount
      of chiccory is considered an improvement, owing to the bitter principle
      and volatile oil which it contains. Chiccory is void of caffeine. The
      addition of chiccory may be detected by adding cold water to supposed
      coffee; if chiccory is present, the liquid will be quickly discolored, and
      chiccory will sink; pure coffee will float.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Buying of Coffee.</strong> Coffee should be bought for family use
      in small quantities, freshly roasted and ground; or, if one has a
      coffee-mill, it may be ground at home as needed. After being ground,
      unless kept air tight, it quickly deteriorates. If not bought in air-tight
      cans, with tight-fitting cover, or glass jar, it should be emptied into
      canister as soon as brought from grocer’s.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of coffee, or decoction
      of coffee. Commonly speaking, boiled coffee is
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>preferred, and is more
      economical for the consumer. Coffee is ground fine, coarse, and medium;
      and the grinding depends on the way in which it is to be made. For
      filtered coffee have it finely ground; for boiled, coarse or medium.

      boiled, coffee is cloudy; if boiled too long, too much tannic acid is
      developed. The spout of pot should be covered or stuffed with soft paper
      to prevent escape of fragrant aroma. Stir and pour some in a cup to be
      sure that spout is free from grounds. Return to coffee-pot and repeat. Add
      remaining cold water, which perfects clearing. Cold water being heavier
      than hot water sinks to the bottom, carrying grounds with it. Place on
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>back of range for ten minutes,

      Egg-shells may be saved and used for clearing coffee. Three egg-shells are
      sufficient to effect clearing where one cup of ground coffee is used. The
      shell performs no office in clearing except for the albumen which clings
      to it. Burnett’s Crystal Coffee Settler, or salt fish-skin, washed, dried,
      and cut in inch pieces, is used for same purpose.

    <p class="c009">
      Coffee made with an egg has a rich flavor which egg alone can give. Where
      strict economy is necessary, if great care is taken, egg may be omitted.
      Coffee so made should be served from range, as much motion causes it to
      become roiled.

    <p class="c019">
      The preparations on the market made from the kola-nut have much the same
      effect upon the system as coffee and chocolate, inasmuch as they contain
      caffeine and theobromine; they are also valuable for their diastase and a
      milk-digesting ferment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">COCOA AND CHOCOLATE</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The cacao-tree (<em>Theobroma cacao</em>) is native to Mexico. Although
      successfully cultivated between the twentieth parallels of latitude, its
      industry is chiefly confined to Mexico, South America, and the West
      Indies. Cocoa and chocolate are both prepared from seeds of the cocoa
      bean. The bean pod is from seven to ten inches long, and three to four and
      one-half inches in diameter. Each pod contains from twenty to forty seeds,
      imbedded in mucilaginous material. Cocoa beans are dried previous to
      importation. Like coffee, they need roasting to develop flavor. After
      roasting, outer covering of bean is removed; this covering makes what is
      known as <em>cocoa shells</em>, which have little nutritive value. The
      beans are broken and sold as <em>cocoa nibs</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The various preparations of cocoa on the market are made from the ground
      cocoa nibs, from which, by means of hydraulic pressure, a large amount of
      fat is expressed, leaving a solid cake. This in turn is pulverized and
      mixed with sugar, and frequently a small amount of corn-starch or
      arrowroot. To some preparations cinnamon or vanilla is added. Broma
      contains both arrowroot and cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Chocolate is made from cocoa nibs, but contains a much larger proportion
      of fat than cocoa preparations. Bitter, sweet, or flavored chocolate is
      always sold in cakes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>The fat obtained from cocoa
      bean is <em>cocoa butter</em>, which gives cocoa its principal nutrient.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Cocoa and chocolate differ from tea and coffee inasmuch as they contain
      nutriment as well as stimulant. <em>Theobromine</em>, the active
      principle, is almost identical with theine and caffeine in its composition
      and effects.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Many people who abstain from the use of tea and coffee find cocoa
      indispensable. Not only is it valuable for its own nutriment, but for the
      large amount of milk added to it. Cocoa may be well placed in the dietary
      of a child after his third year, while chocolate should be avoided as a
      beverage, but may be given as a confection. Invalids and those of weak
      digestion can take cocoa where chocolate would prove too rich.

        CHAPTER IV: BREAD AND BREAD MAKING</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Bread is the most important article of food, and history tells of its use
      thousands of years before the Christian era. Many processes have been
      employed in making and baking; and as a result, from the first flat cake
      has come the perfect loaf. The study of bread making is of no slight
      importance, and deserves more attention than it receives.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Considering its great value, it seems unnecessary and wrong to find poor
      bread on the table; and would that our standard might be raised as high as
      that of our friends across the water! Who does not appreciate the loaf
      produced by the French baker, who has worked months to learn the art of
      bread making?
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by addition of water,
      salt, and a ferment. Wheat flour is best adapted for bread making, as it
      contains gluten in the right proportion to make the spongy loaf. But for
      its slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food; hence arose
      the custom of spreading it with butter. It should be remembered, in
      speaking of wheat bread as perfect food, that it must be made of flour
      rich in gluten. Next to wheat flour ranks rye in importance for bread
      making; but it is best used in combination with wheat, for alone it makes
      heavy, sticky, moist bread. Corn also needs to be used in combination with
      wheat for bread making, for if used alone the bread will be crumbly.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The miller, in order to produce flour which will make the white loaf (so
      sightly to many), in the process of grinding wheat has been forced to
      remove the inner bran coats, so rich in mineral matter, and much of the
      gluten intimately connected with them.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>To understand better the
      details of bread making, wheat, from which bread is principally made,
      should be considered.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      A grain of wheat consists of (1) an outer covering or husk, which is
      always removed before milling; (2) bran coats, which contain mineral
      matter; (3) gluten, the proteid matter and fat; and (4) starch, the centre
      and largest part of the grain. Wheat is distinguished as
      <em>white</em> and <em>soft</em>, or <em>red</em> and <em>hard</em>. The
      former is known as <em>winter wheat</em>, having been sown in the fall,
      and living through the winter; the latter is known as
      <em>spring wheat</em>, having been sown in the spring. From winter wheat,
      pastry flour, sometimes called St. Louis, is made; from spring wheat,
      bread flour, also called Haxall. St. Louis flour takes its name from the
      old process of grinding; Haxall, from the name of the inventor of the new
      process. All flours are now milled by the same process. For difference in
      composition of wheat flours, consult table in Chapter VI on Cereals.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Wheat is milled for converting into flour by processes producing
      essentially the same results, all requiring cleansing, grinding, and
      bolting. Entire wheat flour has only the outer husk removed, the remainder
      of the kernel being finely ground. <em>Graham flour</em>, confounded with
      entire wheat, is too often found to be an inferior flour, mixed with
      coarse bran.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Grinding is accomplished by one of four systems: (1) low milling; (2)
      Hungarian system, or high milling; (3) roller-milling; and (4) by a
      machine known as disintegrator.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>In low milling process</strong>, grooved stones are employed for
      grinding. The stones are enclosed in a metal case, and provision is made
      within case for passage of air to prevent wheat from becoming overheated.
      The lower stone being permanently fixed, the upper stone being so balanced
      above it that grooves may exactly correspond, when upper stone rotates,
      sharp edges of grooves meet each other, and operate like a pair of
      scissors. By this process flour is made ready for bolting by one grinding.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>In high milling process</strong>, grooved stones are employed, but
      are kept so far apart that at first the wheat is only bruised, and a
      series of grindings and siftings is necessary. This
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>process is applicable only to
      the hardest wheats, and is partially supplanted by roller-milling.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>In roller-milling</strong>, wheat is subjected to action of a pair
      of steel or chilled-iron horizontal rollers, having toothed surfaces. They
      revolve in opposite directions, at different rates of speed, and have a
      cutting action.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Porcelain rollers, with rough surfaces, are sometimes employed. In this
      system, grinding is accomplished by cutting rather than crushing.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      “The <strong>disintegrator</strong> consists of a pair of circular metal
      disks, set face to face, studded with circles of projecting bars so
      arranged that circles of bars on one disk alternate with those of the
      other. The disks are mounted on the same centre, and so closely set to one
      another that projecting bars of one disk come quite close to plane surface
      of the other. They are enclosed within an external casing. The disks are
      caused to rotate in opposite directions with great rapidity, and the grain
      is almost instantaneously reduced to a powder.”
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      After grinding comes bolting, by which process the different grades of
      flour are obtained. The ground wheat is placed in octagonal cylinders
      (covered with silk or linen bolting-cloth of different degrees of
      fineness), which are allowed to rotate, thus forcing the wheat through.
      The flour from first siftings contains the largest percentage of gluten.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Flour is branded under different names to suit manufacturer or dealer. In
      consequence, the same wheat, milled by the same process, makes flour which
      is sold under different names.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In buying flour, whether bread or pastry, select the best kept by your
      grocer. Some of the well-known brands of bread flour are King Arthur,
      Swan’s Down, Bridal Veil, Columbia, Washburn’s Extra, and Pillbury’s Best;
      of pastry, Best St. Louis. Bread flour should be used in all cases where
      yeast is called for, with few exceptions; in other cases, pastry flour.
      The difference between bread and pastry flour may be readily determined.
      Take bread flour in the hand, close hand tightly, then open, and flour
      will not <span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>keep in shape; if
      allowed to pass through fingers it will feel slightly granular. Take
      pastry flour in the hand, close hand tightly, open, and flour will be in
      shape, having impression of the lines of the hand, and feeling soft and
      velvety to touch. Flour should always be sifted before measuring.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Entire wheat flour</strong> differs from ordinary flour inasmuch
      as it contains all the gluten found in wheat, the outer husk of kernels
      only being removed, the remainder ground to different degrees of fineness
      and left unbolted. Such flours are sold by the different health food
      companies, who have agencies in the large cities. Franklin Mills, Old
      Grist Mill, and Health Food flours are included in this class.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Gluten</strong>, the proteid of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic
      substance, insoluble in water. On account of its great power of expansion,
      it holds the gas developed in bread dough by fermentation, which otherwise
      would escape.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Yeast</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is the lowest form of
      vegetable life. It consists of spores, or germs, found floating in air,
      and belongs to a family of which there are many species. These spores grow
      by budding and division, and multiply very rapidly under favorable
      conditions, and produce fermentation.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Fermentation</strong> is the process by which, under influence of
      air, warmth, moisture, and some ferment, sugar (or dextrose, starch
      converted into sugar) is changed into alcohol
      (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>HO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The
      product of all fermentation is the same. Three kinds are
      considered,—alcoholic, acetic, and lactic. Where bread dough is allowed to
      ferment by addition of yeast, the fermentation is <em>alcoholic</em>;
      where alcoholic fermentation continues too long,
      <em>acetic</em> fermentation sets in, which is a continuation of
      alcoholic. <em>Lactic</em> fermentation is fermentation which takes place
      when milk sours.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for raising bread. The
      compressed yeast cakes done up in tinfoil have long proved satisfactory,
      and are now almost universally used, having replaced the home-made liquid
      yeast. <span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>Never use a yeast cake
      unless perfectly fresh, which may be determined by its light color and
      absence of dark streaks.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The <em>yeast plant</em> is killed at 212° F.; life is suspended, but not
      entirely destroyed, 32° F. The temperature best suited for its growth is
      from 65° to 68° F. The most favorable conditions for the growth of yeast
      are a warm, moist, sweet, nitrogenous soil. These must be especially
      considered in bread making.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Bread Making</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      <strong>Fermented bread</strong> is made by mixing to a dough, flour, with
      a definite quantity of water, milk, or water and milk, salt, and a
      ferment. Sugar is usually added to hasten fermentation. Dough is then
      kneaded that the ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated, covered, and
      allowed to rise in a temperature of 68° F., until dough has doubled its
      bulk. This change has been caused by action of the ferment, which attacks
      some of the starch in flour, and changes it to sugar, and sugar in turn to
      alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus lightening the whole mass. Dough is then
      kneaded a second time to break bubbles and distribute evenly the carbon
      dioxide. It is shaped in loaves, put in greased bread pans (they being
      half filled), covered, allowed to rise in temperature same as for first
      rising, to double its bulk. If risen too long, it will be full of large
      holes; if not risen long enough, it will be heavy and soggy. If pans
      containing loaves are put in too hot a place while rising, a heavy streak
      will be found near bottom of loaf.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>How to Shape Loaves and Biscuits.</strong> To shape bread dough in
      loaves, divide dough in parts, each part large enough for a loaf, knead
      until smooth, and if possible avoid seams in under part of loaf. If baked
      in brick pan, place two loaves in one pan, brushed between with a little
      melted butter. If baked in long shallow pan, when well kneaded, roll with
      both hands to lengthen, care being taken that it is smooth and of uniform
      thickness. Where long loaves are baked on sheets, shape and roll loosely
      in a towel sprinkled with corn meal for last rising.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>To shape bread dough in
      biscuits, pull or cut off as many small pieces (having them of uniform
      size) as there are to be biscuits. Flour palms of hands slightly; take up
      each piece and shape separately, lifting, with thumb and first two fingers
      of right hand, and placing in palm of left hand, constantly moving dough
      round and round, while folding towards the centre; when smooth, turn it
      over and roll between palms of hands. Place in greased pans near together,
      brushed between with a little melted butter, which will cause biscuits to
      separate easily after baking. For finger rolls, shape biscuits and roll
      with one hand on part of board where there is no flour, until of desired
      length, care being taken to make smooth, of uniform size, and round at
      ends.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Biscuits may be shaped in a great variety of ways, but they should always
      be small. Large biscuits, though equally good, never tempt one by their
      daintiness.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Bread is often brushed over with milk before baking, to make a darker
      crust.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece of yeast cake
      must be used; one-fourth yeast cake to one pint liquid is sufficient,
      one-third yeast cake to one quart liquid. Bread mixed and baked during the
      day requires a larger quantity of yeast; one yeast cake, or sometimes even
      more, to one pint of liquid. Bread dough mixed with a large quantity of
      yeast should be watched during rising, and cut down as soon as mixture
      doubles its bulk. If proper care is taken, the bread will be found most
      satisfactory, having neither “yeasty” nor sour taste.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Fermented bread was formerly raised by means of leaven.</p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baking of Bread</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Bread is baked: (1) To kill ferment, (2) to make soluble the starch, (3)
      to drive off alcohol and carbon dioxide, and (4) to form brown crust of
      pleasant flavor. Bread should be baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too
      hot the crust will brown quickly before the heat has reached the centre,
      and prevent further rising; loaf should continue rising for first fifteen
      minutes of baking, when it should begin to brown,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>and continue browning for the
      next twenty minutes. The last fifteen minutes it should finish baking,
      when the heat may be reduced. When bread is done, it will not cling to
      sides of pan, and may be easily removed. Biscuits require more heat than
      loaf bread, should continue rising the first five minutes, and begin to
      brown in eight minutes. Experience is the best guide for testing
      temperature of oven. Various oven thermometers have been made, but none
      have proved practical. Bread may be brushed over with melted butter, three
      minutes before removal from oven, if a more tender crust is desired.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Care of Bread after Baking</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove loaves at once from pans, and place side down on a wire bread or
      cake cooler. If a crisp crust is desired, allow bread to cool without
      covering; if soft crust, cover with a towel during cooling. When cool, put
      in tin box or stone jar, and cover closely.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will absorb moisture and
      transmit an unpleasant taste to bread. Bread tins or jars should be washed
      and scalded twice a week in winter, and every other day in summer;
      otherwise bread is apt to mould. As there are so many ways of using small
      and stale pieces of bread, care should be taken that none is wasted.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Unfermented bread</strong> is raised without a ferment, the carbon
      dioxide being produced by the use of soda (alkaline salt) and an acid.
      Soda, employed in combination with cream of tartar, for raising mixtures,
      in proportion of one-third soda to two-thirds cream of tartar, was
      formerly used to a great extent, but has been generally superseded by
      baking powder.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Soda bicarbonate</strong> (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) is manufactured from
      sodium chloride (NaCl), common salt or cryolite.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Baking powder</strong> is composed of soda and cream of tartar in
      definite, correct proportions, mixed with small quantity of dry material
      (flour or corn-starch) to keep action from taking place. If found to
      contain alum or ammonia, it is
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>impure. In using baking powder,
      allow two teaspoons baking powder to each cup of flour, when eggs are not
      used; to egg mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoons baking powder. When
      a recipe calls for soda and cream of tartar, in substituting baking powder
      use double amount of cream of tartar given.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      These rules apply to the various soda and cream of tartar baking powders
      on the market. Horsford’s Baking Powder, the only mineral one, requires
      one-third less than others.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Soda and cream of tartar, or baking powder mixtures, are made light by
      liberation of gas in mixture; the gas in soda is set free by the acid in
      cream of tartar; in order to accomplish this, moisture and heat are both
      required. As soon as moisture is added to baking powder mixtures, the gas
      will begin to escape; hence the necessity of baking as soon as possible.
      If baking powder only is used for raising, put mixture to be cooked in a
      hot oven.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cream of tartar</strong>
      (HKC<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) is obtained from argols found
      adhering to bottom and sides of wine casks, which are ninety per cent
      cream of tartar. The argols are ground and dissolved in boiling water,
      coloring matter removed by filtering through animal charcoal, and by a
      process of recrystallization the cream of tartar of commerce is obtained.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The acid found in molasses, sour milk, and lemon juice will liberate gas
      in soda, but the action is much quicker than when cream of tartar is used.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fermented and unfermented breads are raised to be made light and porous,
      that they may be easily acted upon by the digestive ferments. Some
      mixtures are made light by beating sufficiently to enclose a large amount
      of air, and when baked in a hot oven air is forced to expand.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Aerated bread</strong> is made light by carbon dioxide forced into
      dough under pressure. The carbon dioxide is generated from sulphuric acid
      and lime. Aerated bread is of close texture, and has a flavor peculiar to
      itself. It is a product of the baker’s skill, but has found little favor
      except in few localities.

      mixing-spoon. Add remaining flour, mix, and turn on a floured board,
      leaving a clean bowl; knead until mixture is smooth, elastic to touch, and
      bubbles may be seen under the surface. Some practice is required to knead
      quickly, but the motion once acquired will never be forgotten. Return to
      bowl, cover with a clean cloth kept for the purpose, and board or tin
      cover; let rise over night in temperature of 65° F. In morning cut down:
      this is accomplished by cutting through and turning over dough several
      times with a case knife, and checks fermentation for a short time; dough
      may be again raised, and recut down if it is not convenient to shape into
      loaves or biscuits after first cutting. When properly cared for, bread
      need never sour. Toss on board slightly floured, knead, shape into loaves
      or biscuits, place in greased pans, having pans nearly half full. Cover,
      let rise again to double its bulk, and bake in hot oven. (See Baking of

      tied down with string; otherwise the bread in rising might force off
      cover. Mould should never be filled more than two-thirds full. A melon
      mould or one-pound baking-powder boxes make the most attractive-shaped
      loaves, but a five-pound lard pail answers the purpose. For steaming,
      place mould on a trivet in kettle containing boiling water, allowing water
      to come half-way up around mould, cover closely, and steam, adding, as
      needed, more boiling water.

    <h3 class="c018">Bread for Garnishing</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Dry toast is often used for garnishing, cut in various shapes. Always
      shape before toasting. Cubes of bread, toast points, and small oblong
      pieces are most common. Cubes of stale bread, from which centres are
      removed, are fried in deep fat and called croûstades; half-inch cubes,
      browned in butter, or fried in deep fat, are called croûtons.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Uses for Stale Bread</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      All pieces of bread should be saved and utilized. Large pieces are best
      for toast. Soft stale bread, from which crust is removed, when crumbed, is
      called stale breadcrumbs, or raspings, and is used for puddings,
      griddle-cakes, omelets, scalloped dishes, and dipping food to be fried.
      Remnants of bread, from which crusts have not been removed, are dried in
      oven, rolled, and sifted. These are called dry bread crumbs, and are
      useful for crumbing croquettes, cutlets, fish, meat, etc.

      Cereals (cultivated grasses) rank first among vegetable foods; being of
      hardy growth and easy cultivation, they are more widely diffused over the
      globe than any of the flowering plants. They include wheat, oats, rye,

    <p class="c009">
      <em>Macaroni</em>, <em>spaghetti</em>, and <em>vermicelli</em> are made
      from wheaten flour, rich in gluten, moistened to a stiff dough with water,
      and forced through small apertures in an iron plate by means of a screw
      press. Various Italian pastes are made from the same mixture. Macaroni is
      manufactured to some extent in this country, but the best comes from
      Italy, Lagana and Pejero, being the favorite brand. When macaroni is
      colored, it is done by the use of saffron, not by eggs, as is generally
      supposed. The only egg macaroni is manufactured in strips, and comes from
      Minneapolis.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>Macaroni is valuable food, as
      it is very cheap and nutritious; but being deficient in fat, it should be
      combined with cream, butter, or cheese, to make a perfect food.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      From cereals many preparations are made, used alone, or in combination
      with other food products. From rice is made rice flour; from oats,
      oatmeal, and oats steam-cooked and rolled,—as Rolled Avena, Quaker Rolled
      Oats, H-O, etc. There are many species of corn, the principal varieties
      being white, yellow, and red. From corn is made corn meal,—both white and
      yellow,—corn-starch, hominy, maizena, cerealine, samp, and hulled corn;
      from wheat, wheaten or white flour, Wheatena, Wheatlet, Rolled Wheat,
      Pettijohn’s, etc. Rye is used for Rye Flakes, meal, and flour; barley, for
      flour and pearl barley. Buckwheat, throughout the United States, is used
      only when made into flour for buckwheat cakes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For family use, cereals should be bought in small quantities, and kept in
      glass jars, tightly covered. Many cereal preparations are on the market
      for making breakfast mushes, put up in one and two pound packages, with
      directions for cooking. In nearly all cases, time allowed for cooking is
      not sufficient, unless dish containing cereal is brought in direct contact
      with fire, which is not the best way. Mushes should be cooked over hot
      water after the first five minutes; if a double boiler is not procurable,
      improvise one. Boiling water and salt should always be added to cereals,
      allowing one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal,—boiled to soften
      cellulose and swell starch-grains, salted to give flavor. Indian meal and
      finely ground preparations should be mixed with cold water before adding
      boiling water, to prevent lumping.

      Eggs, like milk, form a typical food, inasmuch as they contain all the
      elements, in the right proportion, necessary for the support of the body.
      Their highly concentrated, nutritive value renders it necessary to use
      them in combination with other foods rich in starch (bread, potatoes,
      etc.). In order that the stomach may have enough to act upon, a certain
      amount of bulk must be furnished.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      A pound of eggs (nine) is equivalent in nutritive value to a pound of
      beef. From this it may be seen that eggs, at even twenty-five cents per
      dozen, should not be freely used by the strict economist. Eggs being rich
      in proteid serve as a valuable substitute for meat. In most families,
      their use in the making of cake, custard, puddings, etc., renders them
      almost indispensable. It is surprising how many intelligent women, who
      look well to the affairs of the kitchen, are satisfied to use what are
      termed “cooking eggs”; this shows poor judgment from an economical
      standpoint. Strictly fresh eggs should always be used if obtainable. An
      egg after the first twenty-four hours steadily deteriorates. If exposed to
      air, owing to the porous structure of the shell, there is an evaporation
      of water, air rushes in, and decomposition takes place.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      White of egg contains albumen in its purest form. Albumen coagulates at a
      temperature of from 134° to 160° F. Herein lies the importance of cooking
      eggs at a low temperature, thus rendering them easy of digestion. Eggs
      cooked <span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>in boiling water are
      tough and horny, difficult of digestion, and should never be served.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When eggs come from the market, they should be washed, and put away in a
      cold place.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Ways of Determining Freshness of Eggs.</strong> I. Hold in front
      of candle flame in dark room, and the centre should look clear.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">II. Place in basin of cold water, and they should sink.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      III. Place large end to the cheek, and a warmth should be felt.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Ways of Keeping Eggs.</strong> I. Pack in sawdust, small end down.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">II. Keep in lime water.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      III. From July to September a large number of eggs are packed, small ends
      down, in cases having compartments, one for each egg, and kept in cold
      storage. Eggs are often kept in cold storage six months, and then sold as
      cooking eggs.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Eggs</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. Carefully put in with a
      spoon the number of eggs desired, covering them with water. Remove
      saucepan to back of range, where water will not boil. Cook from six to
      eight minutes if liked “soft-boiled,” forty to forty-five if liked
      “hard-boiled.” Eggs may be cooked by placing in cold water and allowing
      water to heat gradually until the boiling-point is reached, when they will
      be “soft-boiled.” In using hard-boiled eggs for making other dishes, when
      taken from the hot water they should be plunged into cold water to
      prevent, if possible, discoloration of yolks.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Eggs perfectly cooked should be placed and kept in water at a uniform
      temperature of 175° F.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Dropped Eggs (Poached)</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Have ready a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling salted water, allowing
      one-half tablespoon salt to one quart of water. Put two or three buttered
      muffin rings in the water. Break each egg separately into a cup, and
      carefully slip into a muffin ring. The water should cover the eggs. When
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>there is a film over the top,
      and the white is firm, carefully remove with a buttered skimmer to
      circular pieces of buttered toast, and let each person season his own egg
      with butter, salt, and pepper. If cooked for an invalid, garnish with four
      toast points and a bit of parsley. An egg-poacher may be used instead of
      muffin rings.

        CHAPTER VIII: SOUPS</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      It cannot be denied that the French excel all nations in the excellence of
      their cuisine, and to their soups and sauces belong the greatest praise.
      It would be well to follow their example, and it is the duty of every
      housekeeper to learn the art of soup making. How may a hearty dinner be
      better begun than with a thin soup? The hot liquid, taken into an empty
      stomach, is easily assimilated, acts as a stimulant rather than a nutrient
      (as is the popular opinion), and prepares the way for the meal which is to
      follow. The cream soups and purées are so nutritious that, with bread and
      butter, they furnish a satisfactory meal.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Soups are divided into two great classes: soups with stock; soups without
      stock.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Soups with stock have, for their basis, beef, veal, mutton, fish, poultry,
      or game, separately or in combination. They are classified as:—
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Bouillon</strong>, made from lean beef, delicately seasoned, and
      usually cleared. Exception,—clam bouillon.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Brown Soup Stock</strong>, made from beef (two-thirds lean meat,
      and remainder bone and fat), highly seasoned with vegetables, spices, and
      sweet herbs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>White Soup Stock</strong>, made from chicken or veal, with
      delicate seasonings.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Consommé</strong>, usually made from two or three kinds of meat
      (beef, veal, and fowl being employed), highly seasoned with vegetables,
      spices, and sweet herbs. Always served clear.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Lamb Stock</strong>, delicately seasoned, is served as mutton
      broth.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Soups without stock are classified as:—</p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cream Soups</strong>, made of vegetables or fish, with milk, and a
      small amount of cream and seasonings. Always thickened.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Purées</strong>, made from vegetables or fish, forced through
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>a strainer, and retained in
      soup, milk, and seasonings. Generally thicker than cream soup. Sometimes
      White Stock is added.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Bisques</strong>, generally made from shell-fish, milk, and
      seasonings, and served with fish dice; made similarly to purées. They may
      be made of meat, game, or vegetables, with small dice of the same.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Various names have been given to soups, according to their flavorings,
      chief ingredients, the people who use them, etc. To the Scotch belongs
      Scotch Broth; to the French, Pot-au-feu; to the Indo, Mulligatawny; and to
      the Spanish, Olla Podrida.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">SOUP MAKING</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The art of soup making is more easily mastered than at first appears. The
      young housekeeper is startled at the amazingly large number of ingredients
      the recipe calls for, and often is discouraged. One may, with but little
      expense, keep at hand what is essential for the making of a good soup.
      Winter vegetables—turnips, carrots, celery, and onions—may be bought in
      large or small quantities. The outer stalks of celery, often not suitable
      for serving, should be saved for soups. At seasons when celery is a
      luxury, the tips and roots should be saved and dried. Sweet herbs,
      including thyme, savory, and marjoram, are dried and put up in packages,
      retailing from five to ten cents. Bay leaves, which should be used
      sparingly, may be obtained at first-class grocers’ or druggists’; seeming
      never to lose strength, they may be kept indefinitely. Spices, including
      whole cloves, allspice berries, peppercorns, and stick cinnamon, should be
      kept on hand. These seasonings, with the addition of salt, pepper, and
      parsley, are the essential flavorings for stock soups. Flour, corn-starch,
      arrowroot, fine tapioca, sago, pearl barley, rice, bread, or eggs are
      added to give consistency and nourishment.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In small families, where there are few left-overs, fresh meat must be
      bought for the making of soup stock, as a good soup cannot be made from a
      small amount of poor material. On the other hand, large families need
      seldom <span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>buy fresh meat,
      provided all left-overs are properly cared for. The soup kettle should
      receive small pieces of beef (roasted, broiled, or stewed), veal,
      carcasses of fowl or chicken, chop bones, bones left from lamb roast, and
      all trimmings and bones, which a careful housewife should see are sent
      from the market with her order. Avoid the use of smoked or corned meats,
      or large pieces of raw mutton or lamb surrounded by fat, on account of the
      strong flavor so disagreeable to many. A small piece of bacon or lean ham
      is sometimes cooked with vegetables for flavor.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Beef ranks first as regards utility and economy in soup making. It should
      be cut from the fore or hind shin (which cuts contain marrow-bone), the
      middle cuts being most desirable. If the lower part of shin is used, the
      soup, although rich in gelatin, lacks flavor, unless a cheap piece of lean
      meat is used with it, which frequently is done. It must be remembered that
      meat, bone, and fat in the right proportions are all necessary; allow
      two-thirds lean meat, the remaining one-third bone and fat. From the meat
      the soluble juices, salts, extractives (which give color and flavor), and
      a small quantity of gelatin are extracted; from the bone, gelatin (which
      gives the stock when cold a jelly-like consistency) and mineral matter.
      Gelatin is also obtained from cartilage, skin, tendons, and ligaments.
      Some of the fat is absorbed; the remainder rises to the top and should be
      removed.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Soup stock making is rendered easier by use of proper utensils. Sharp meat
      knives, hardwood board, two purée strainers having meshes of different
      size, and a soup digester (a porcelain-lined iron pot, having
      tight-fitting cover, with valve in the top), or covered granite kettle,
      are essentials. An iron kettle, which formerly constituted one of the
      furnishings of a range, may be used if perfectly smooth. A saw, cleaver,
      and scales, although not necessary, are useful, and lighten labor.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When meat comes from market, remove from paper and put in cool place. When
      ready to start stock, if scales are at hand, weigh meat and bone to see if
      correct proportions have been sent. Wipe meat with clean cheese-cloth
      wrung out of cold water. Cut lean meat in one-inch cubes; by so
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>doing, a large amount of
      surface is exposed to the water, and juices are more easily drawn out.
      Heat frying-pan hissing hot; remove marrow from marrow-bone, and use
      enough to brown one-third of the lean meat, stirring constantly, that all
      parts of surface may be seared, thus preventing escape of
      juices,—sacrificing a certain amount of goodness in the stock to give
      additional color and flavor, which is obtained by caramelization. Put fat,
      bone, and remaining lean meat in soup kettle; cover with cold water,
      allowing one pint to each pound of meat, bone, and fat. Let stand one
      hour, that cold water may draw out juices from meat. Add browned meat,
      taking water from soup kettle to rinse out frying-pan, that none of the
      coloring may be lost. Heat gradually to boiling-point, and cook six or
      seven hours at low temperature. A scum will rise on the top, which
      contains coagulated albuminous juices; these give to soup its chief
      nutritive value; many, however, prefer a clear soup, and have them
      removed. If allowed to remain, when straining, a large part will pass
      through strainer. Vegetables, spices, and salt should be added the last
      hour of cooking. Strain and cool quickly; by so doing, stock is less apt
      to ferment. A knuckle of veal is often used for making white soup stock.
      Fowl should be used for stock in preference to chicken, as it is cheaper,
      and contains a larger amount of nutriment. A cake of fat forms on stock
      when cold, which excludes air, and should not be removed until stock is
      used. To remove fat, run a knife around edge of bowl and carefully remove
      the same. A small quantity will remain, which should be removed by passing
      a cloth wrung out of hot water around edge and over top of stock. This fat
      should be clarified and used for drippings. If time cannot be allowed for
      stock to cool before using, take off as much fat as possible with a spoon,
      and remove the remainder by passing tissue or any absorbent paper over the
      surface.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">How to Clear Soup Stock</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Whites of eggs slightly beaten, or raw, lean beef finely chopped, are
      employed for clearing soup stock. The albumen
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>found in each effects the
      clearing by drawing to itself some of the juices which have been extracted
      from the meat, and by action of heat have been coagulated. Some rise to
      the top and form a scum, others are precipitated.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared in stewpan, allowing
      white and shell of one egg to each quart of stock. Beat egg slightly,
      break shell in small pieces and add to stock. Place on front of range, and
      stir constantly until boiling-point is reached; boil two minutes. Set back
      where it may simmer twenty minutes; remove scum, and strain through double
      thickness of cheese-cloth placed over a fine strainer. If stock to be
      cleared is not sufficiently seasoned, additional seasoning must be added
      as soon as stock has lost its jelly-like consistency; not after clearing
      is effected. Many think the flavor obtained from a few shavings of lemon
      rind an agreeable addition.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">How to Bind Soups</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Cream soups and purées, if allowed to stand, separate, unless bound
      together. To bind a soup, melt butter, and when bubbling add an equal
      quantity of flour; when well mixed add to boiling soup, stirring
      constantly. If recipe calls for more flour than butter, or soup is one
      that should be made in double boiler, add gradually a portion of hot
      mixture to butter and flour until of such consistency that it may be
      poured into the mixture remaining in double boiler.

      strain into a stewpan. Parboil potatoes five minutes in boiling water to
      cover; drain, and put a layer in bottom of stewpan, add chopped clams,
      sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge generously with flour; add
      remaining potatoes, again sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with
      flour, and add two and one-half cups boiling water. Cook ten minutes, add
      milk, soft part of clams, and butter; boil three minutes, and add crackers

      between tablespoons, making an oval, or by forcing mixture through pastry
      bag on buttered paper. They are cooked in boiling salted water or stock,
      and are served as garnish to soups or other dishes; when served with
      sauce, they are an entrée.

        CHAPTER XI: FISH</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      The meat of fish is the animal food next in importance to that of birds
      and mammals. Fish meat, with but few exceptions, is less stimulating and
      nourishing than meat of other animals, but is usually easier of digestion.
      Salmon, mackerel, and eels are exceptions to these rules, and should not
      be eaten by those of weak digestion. White fish, on account of their easy
      digestibility, are especially desirable for those of sedentary habits.
      Fish is not recommended for brain-workers on account of the large amount
      of phosphorus (an element abounding largely in nerve tissue) which it
      contains, but because of its easy digestibility. It is a conceded fact
      that many fish contain less of this element than meat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fish meat is generally considered cheaper than meat of other animals. This
      is true when compared with the better cuts of meat, but not so when
      compared with cheaper cuts.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it should be eaten
      fresh, and in season. Turbot, which is improved by keeping, is the only
      exception to this rule.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>To Determine Freshness of Fish.</em> Examine the flesh, and it should
      be firm; the eyes and gills, and they should be bright.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Broiling and baking are best methods for cooking fish. White fish may
      often be fried, but oily rarely. Frozen fish are undesirable, but if used,
      should be thawed in cold water just before cooking.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      On account of its strong odor, fish should never be put in an ice-box with
      other food, unless closely covered. A tin lard pail will be found useful
      for this purpose.
    </p>

      <h3 class="c018">White and Oily Fish</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      White fish have fat secreted in the liver. Examples: cod, haddock, trout,
      flounder, smelt, perch, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Oily fish have fat distributed throughout the flesh. Examples: salmon,
      eels, mackerel, bluefish, swordfish, shad, herring, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Cod</strong> belongs to one of the most prolific fish families
      (Gadidoe), and is widely distributed throughout the northern and temperate
      seas of both hemispheres. On account of its abundance, cheapness, and easy
      procurability, it forms, from an economical standpoint, one of the most
      important fish foods. Cod have been caught weighing over a hundred pounds,
      but average market cod weigh from six to ten pounds; a six-pound cod
      measures about twenty-three inches in length. Large cod are cut into
      steaks. The skin of cod is white, heavily mottled with gray, with a white
      line running the entire length of fish on either side. Cod is caught in
      shallow or deep waters. Shallow-water cod (caught off rocks) is called
      rock cod; deep-water cod is called off-shore cod. Rock cod are apt to be
      wormy. Cod obtained off George’s Banks, Newfoundland, are called George’s
      cod, and are commercially known as the best fish. Quantities of cod are
      preserved by drying and salting. Salted George’s cod is the best brand on
      the market. Cod is in season throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Cod Liver Oil</em> is obtained from cods’ livers, and has great
      therapeutic value. Isinglass, made from swimming bladder of cod, nearly
      equals in quality that made from bladder of sturgeon.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">
      <strong>Haddock</strong> is more closely allied to cod than any other
      fish.
    </h3>
    <p class="c019">
      It is smaller (its average weight being about four pounds), and
      differently mottled. The distinguishing mark of the haddock is a black
      line running the entire length of fish on either side. Haddock is found in
      the same water and in company with cod, but not so abundantly. Like cod,
      haddock is cheap, and in season throughout the year. Haddock, when dried,
      smoked, and salted, is known as <em>Finnan Haddie</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Halibut</strong> is the largest of the flatfish family
      (Pleuronectidæ), <span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span>specimens
      having been caught weighing from three to four hundred pounds. Small, or
      chicken, halibut is the kind usually found in market, and weighs from
      fifteen to twenty-five pounds. Halibut are distinctively cold-water fish,
      being caught in water at from 32° to 45° F. They are found in the North
      Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, where they are nearly identical. The
      halibut has a compressed body, the skin on one side being white, on the
      other light, or dark gray, and both eyes are found on the dark side of
      head. Halibut is in season throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Turbot</strong> (called little halibut) is a species of the
      flatfish family, being smaller than halibut, and of more delicate flavor.
      Turbot are in season from January to March.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Flounder</strong> is a small flatfish, which closely resembles the
      sole which is caught in English waters, and is often served under that
      name.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Trout</strong> are generally fresh water fish, varying much in
      size and skin-coloring. Lake trout, which are the largest, reach their
      greatest perfection in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, but are found
      in many lakes. Salmon trout is the name applied to trout caught in New
      York lakes. Brook trout, caught in brooks and small lakes, are superior
      eating. Trout are in season from April to August, but a few are found
      later.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Whitefish</strong> is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Smelts</strong> are small salt-water fish, and are usually caught
      in temperate waters at the mouths of rivers. New Brunswick and Maine send
      large quantities of smelts to market. Selected smelts are the largest in
      size, and command higher price. The Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective
      Law forbids their sale from March 15th to June 1st. Smelts are always sold
      by the pound.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Bluefish</strong> belongs to the Pomatomidæ family. It is widely
      distributed in temperate waters, taking different names in different
      localities. In New England and the Middle States it is generally called
      Bluefish, although in some parts called Snappers, or Snapping Mackerel. In
      the Southern States it is called Greenfish. It is in season in our markets
      from May to October; as it is frozen and kept in cold storage from
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>six to nine months, it may be
      obtained throughout the year. The heavier the fish, the better its
      quality. Bluefish weigh from one to eight pounds, and are from fourteen to
      twenty-nine inches in length.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Mackerel</strong> is one of the best-known food fishes, and is
      caught in North Atlantic waters. Its skin is lustrous dark blue above,
      with wavy blackish lines, and silvery below. It sometimes attains a length
      of eighteen inches, but is usually less. Mackerel weigh from three-fourths
      of a pound to two pounds, and are sold by the piece. They are in season
      from May 1st to September 1st. Mackerel, when first in market, contain
      less fat than later in the season, therefore are easier of digestion. The
      supply of mackerel varies greatly from year to year, and some years is
      very small. <em>Spanish mackerel</em> are found in waters farther south
      than common mackerel, and in our markets command higher price.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Salmon</strong> live in both fresh and salt waters, always going,
      inland, usually to the head of rivers, during the spawning season. The
      young after a time seek salt water, but generally return to fresh water.
      Penobscot River Salmon are the best, and come from Maine and St. John, New
      Brunswick. The average weight of salmon is from fifteen to twenty-five
      pounds, and the flesh is of pinkish orange color. Salmon are in season
      from May to September, but frozen salmon may be obtained the greater part
      of the year. In the Columbia River and its tributaries salmon are so
      abundant that extensive canneries are built along the banks.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Shad</strong>, like salmon, are found in both salt and fresh
      water, always ascending rivers for spawning. Shad is caught on the
      Atlantic Coast of the United States, and its capture constitutes one of
      the most important fisheries. Shad have a silvery hue, which becomes
      bluish on the back; they vary in length from eighteen to twenty-eight
      inches, and are always sold by the piece, price being irrespective of
      size. <em>Jack shad</em> are usually cheaper than <em>roe shad</em>. The
      roe of shad is highly esteemed. Shad are in season from January to June.
      First shad in market come from Florida, and retail from one and one-half
      to two dollars each. The finest come from New Brunswick, and appear in
      market about the first of May.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span><em>Caviare</em> is the
      salted roe of the sturgeon.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Herring</strong> are usually smoked, or smoked and salted, and,
      being very cheap, are a most economical food.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">SHELLFISH</h3>
    <h4 class="c021">I. Bivalve Mollusks</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      <strong>Oysters</strong> are mollusks, having two shells. The shells are
      on the right and left side of the oyster, and are called right and left
      valves. The one upon which the oyster rests grows faster, becomes deeper,
      and is known as the left valve. The valves are fastened by a ligament,
      which, on account of its elasticity, admits of opening and closing of the
      shells. The oyster contains a tough muscle, by which it is attached to the
      shell; the body is made up largely of the liver (which contains
      <em>glycogen</em>, animal starch), and is partially surrounded by fluted
      layers, which are the gills. Natural oyster beds (or banks) are found in
      shallow salt water having stony bottom, along the entire Atlantic Coast.
      The oyster industry of the world is chiefly in the United States and
      France, and on account of its increase many artificial beds have been
      prepared for oyster culture. Oysters are five years old before suitable
      for eating. Blue Points, which are small, plump oysters, take their name
      from Blue Point, Long Island, from which place they originally came. Their
      popularity grew so rapidly that the supply became inadequate for the
      demand, and any small, plump oysters were soon sold for Blue Points.
      During the oyster season they form the first course of a dinner, served
      raw on the half shell. In our markets, selected oysters (which are
      extremely large and used for broiling) Providence River, and Norfolk
      oysters are familiarly known, and, taken out of the shells, are sold by
      the quart. Farther south, they are sold by count.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Oysters are obtainable all the year, but are in season from September to
      May. During the summer mouths they are flabby and of poor flavor, although
      when fresh they are perfectly wholesome. <em>Mussels</em>, eaten in
      England and other parts of Europe, are similar to oysters, though of
      inferior <span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>quality. Oysters are
      nutritious and of easy digestibility, especially when eaten raw.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>To Open Oysters.</em> Put a thin flat knife under the back end of the
      right valve, and push forward until it cuts the strong muscle which holds
      the shells together. As soon as this is done, the right valve may be
      raised and separated from the left.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>To Clean Oysters.</em> Put oysters in a strainer placed over a bowl.
      Pour over oysters cold water, allowing one-half cup water to each quart
      oysters. Carefully pick over oysters, taking each one separately in the
      fingers, to remove any particles of shell which adhere to tough muscle.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Clams</strong>, among bivalve mollusks, rank in value next to
      oysters. They are found just below the surface of sand and mud, above
      low-water mark, and are easily dug with shovel or rake. Clams have hard or
      soft shells. Soft-shell clams are dear to the New Englander. From New York
      to Florida are found hard-shelled clams (quahaugs).
      <em>Small quahaugs</em> are called <em>Little Neck Clams</em> and take the
      place of Blue Points at dinner, when Blue Points are out of season.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Scallops</strong> are bivalve mollusks, the best being found in
      Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. The central muscle forms the
      edible portion, and is the only part sent to market. Scallops are in
      season from October first to April first.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">II. Crustaceans</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      <strong>Lobsters</strong> belong to the highest order of Crustaceans, live
      exclusively in sea-water, generally near rocky coasts, and are caught in
      pots set on gravelly bottoms. The largest and best species are found in
      Atlantic waters from Maine to New Jersey, being most abundant on Maine and
      Massachusetts coasts. Lobsters have been found weighing from sixteen to
      twenty-five pounds, but such have been exterminated from our coast. The
      average weight is two pounds, and the length from ten to fifteen inches.
      Lobsters are largest and most abundant from June to September, but are
      obtainable all the year. When taken from the water, shells are of mottled
      dark green color, except <span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>when
      found on sandy bottoms, when they are quite red. Lobsters are generally
      boiled, causing the shell to turn red.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      A lobster consists of body, tail, two large claws, and four pairs of small
      claws. On lower side of body, in front of large claws, are various small
      organs which surround the mouth, and a long and short pair of feelers.
      Under the tail are found several pairs of appendages. In the female
      lobster, also called hen lobster, is found, during the breeding season,
      the spawn, known as <em>coral</em>. Sex is determined by the pair of
      appendages in the tail which lie nearest the body; in the female they are
      soft and pliable, in the male hard and stiff. At one time small lobsters
      were taken in such quantities that it was feared, if the practice was long
      continued, they would be exterminated. To protect the continuance of
      lobster fisheries, a law has been passed in many States prohibiting their
      sale unless at least ten inches long.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lobsters shed their shells at irregular intervals, when old ones are
      outgrown. The new ones begin to form and take on distinctive
      characteristics before the old ones are discarded. New shells after
      twenty-four hours’ exposure to the water are quite hard.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lobsters, being coarse feeders (taking almost any animal substance
      attainable), are difficult of digestion, and with some create great
      gastric disturbance; notwithstanding, they are seldom found diseased.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>To Select a Lobster.</em> Take in the hand, and if heavy in proportion
      to its size, the lobster is fresh. Straighten the tail, and if it springs
      into place the lobster was alive (as it should have been) when put into
      the pot for boiling. There is greater shrinkage in lobsters than in any
      other fish.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>To Open Lobsters.</em> Take off large claws, small claws, and separate
      tail from body. Tail meat may sometimes be drawn out whole with a fork;
      more often it is necessary to cut the thin shell portion (using scissors
      or a can opener) in under part of the tail, then the tail meat may always
      be removed whole. Separate tail meat through centre, and remove the small
      intestinal vein which runs
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>its entire length; although
      generally darker than the meat, it is sometimes found of the same color.
      Hold body shell firmly in left hand, and with first two fingers and thumb
      of right hand draw out the body, leaving in shell the stomach (known as
      the <em>lady</em>), which is not edible, and also some of the green part,
      the <em>liver</em>. The liver may be removed by shaking the shell. The
      sides of the body are covered with the <em>lungs</em>; these are always
      discarded. Break body through the middle and separate body bones, picking
      out meat that lies between them, which is some of the sweetest and
      tenderest to be found. Separate large claws at joints. If shells are thin,
      with a knife cut off a strip down the sharp edge, so that shell may be
      broken apart and meat removed whole. Where shell is thick, it must be
      broken with a mallet or hammer. Small claws are used for garnishing. The
      shell of body, tail, and lower part of large claws, if not broken, may be
      washed, dried, and used for serving of lobster meat after it has been
      prepared. The portions of lobsters which are not edible are
      <em>lungs</em>, <em>stomach</em> (lady), and <em>intestinal vein</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Crabs</strong> among Crustaceans are next in importance to
      lobsters, commercially speaking. They are about two and one-half inches
      long by five inches wide, and are found along the Atlantic Coast from
      Massachusetts to Florida, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Crabs, like lobsters,
      change their shells. <em>Soft-shell</em> crabs are those which have
      recently shed their old shells, and the new shells have not had time to
      harden; these are considered by many a great luxury.
      <em>Oyster crabs</em> (very small crabs found in shells with oysters) are
      a delicacy not often indulged in. Crabs are in season during the spring
      and summer.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Shrimps</strong> are found largely in our Southern waters, the
      largest and best coming from Lake Pontchartrain. They are about two inches
      long, covered with a thin shell, and are boiled and sent to market with
      heads removed. Their grayish color is changed to pink by boiling. Shrimps
      are in season from May first to October first, and are generally used for
      salads. Canned shrimps are much used and favorably known.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span><em>Reptiles.</em> Frogs and
      terrapin belong to a lower order of animals than fish,—reptiles. They are
      both table delicacies, and are eaten by the few.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Only the hind legs of frogs are eaten, and have much the same flavor as
      chicken.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Terrapin, although sold in our large cities, specially belong to
      Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, where they are cooked and served
      at their best. They are shipped from the South, packed in seaweed, and may
      be kept for some time in a dark place. Terrapin are found in both fresh
      and salt-water. The Diamond Back, salt-water terrapin, coming from
      Chesapeake Bay, are considered the best, and command a very high price.
      Terrapin closely resembling Diamond Back, coming from Texas and Florida,
      are principally sold in our markets. Terrapin are in season from November
      to April, but are best in January, February, and March. They should always
      be cooked alive.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">TO PREPARE FISH FOR COOKING</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      <strong>To Clean a Fish.</strong> Fish are cleaned and dressed at market
      as ordered, but need additional cleaning before cooking. Remove scales
      which have not been taken off. This is done by drawing a knife over fish,
      beginning at tail and working towards head, occasionally wiping knife and
      scales from fish. Incline knife slightly towards you to prevent scales
      from flying. The largest number of scales will be found on the flank. Wipe
      thoroughly inside and out with cloth wrung out of cold water, removing any
      clotted blood which may be found adhering to backbone.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Head and tail may or may not be removed, according to size of fish and
      manner of cooking. Small fish are generally served with head and tail left
      on.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Skin a Fish.</strong> With sharp knife remove fins along the
      back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the entire length of back. Loosen
      skin on one side from bony part of gills, and being once started, if fish
      is fresh, it may be readily drawn off; if flesh is soft do not work too
      quickly, as it will be badly torn. By allowing knife to closely follow
      skin this <span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>may be avoided.
      After removing skin from one side, turn fish and skin the other side.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Bone a Fish.</strong> Clean and skin before boning. Beginning
      at the tail, run a sharp knife under flesh close to backbone, and with
      knife follow bone (making as clean a cut as possible) its entire length,
      thus accomplishing the removal of one-half the flesh; turn, and remove
      flesh from other side. Pick out with fingers any small bones that may
      remain. Cod, haddock, halibut, and whitefish are easily and frequently
      boned; flounders and smelts occasionally.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Fillet Fish.</strong> Clean, skin, and bone. A piece of fish,
      large or small, freed from skin and bones, is known as a fillet. Halibut,
      cut in three-fourths inch slices, is more often cut in fillets than any
      kind of fish, and fillets are frequently rolled. When flounder is cut in
      fillets it is served under the name of <em>fillet of sole</em>. Sole found
      in English waters is much esteemed, and flounder is our nearest approach
      to it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">WAYS OF COOKING FISH</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      <em>To Cook Fish in Boiling Water.</em> Small cod, haddock, or cusk are
      cooked whole in enough boiling water to cover, to which is added salt and
      lemon juice or vinegar. Salt gives flavor; lemon juice or vinegar keeps
      the flesh white. A long fish-kettle containing a rack on which to place
      fish is useful but rather expensive. In place of fish-kettle, if the fish
      is not too large to be coiled in it, a frying-basket may be used placed in
      any kettle.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Large fish are cut in thick pieces for boiling, containing the number of
      pounds required. Examples: salmon and halibut.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Pieces cut from large fish for boiling should be cleaned and tied in a
      piece of cheese-cloth to prevent scum being deposited on the fish. If skin
      is not removed before serving, scald the dark skin and scrape to remove
      coloring; this may be easily accomplished by holding fish on two forks,
      and lowering into boiling water the part covered with black skin; then
      remove and scrape. Time required for boiling fish depends on extent of
      surface exposed to water. Consult Time Table for Boiling, which will serve
      as a guide. The fish is cooked when flesh leaves the bone, no matter how
      long the time.

      ><strong>To Broil Fish.</strong> Cod, haddock, bluefish, and mackerel are
      split down the back and broiled whole, removing head and tail or not, as
      desired. Salmon, chicken halibut, and swordfish are cut in inch slices for
      broiling. Smelts and other small fish are broiled whole, without
      splitting. Clean and wipe fish as dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and
      pepper, and place in well-greased wire broiler. Slices of fish should be
      turned often while broiling; whole fish should be first broiled on flesh
      side, then turned and broiled on skin side just long enough to make skin
      brown and crisp.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      To remove from broiler, loosen fish on one side, turn and loosen on other
      side; otherwise flesh will cling to broiler. Slip from broiler to hot
      platter, or place platter over fish and invert platter and broiler
      together.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Bake Fish.</strong> Clean, and bake on a greased fish-sheet
      placed in a dripping-pan. If a fish-sheet is not at hand, place strips of
      cotton cloth under fish, by which it may be lifted from pan.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Fry Fish.</strong> Clean fish, and wipe as dry as possible.
      Sprinkle with salt, dip in flour or crumbs, egg, and crumbs, and fry in
      deep fat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Sauté Fish.</strong> Prepare as for frying, and cook in
      frying-pan with small amount of fat; or, if preferred, dip in granulated
      corn meal. Cod steak and smelts are often cooked in this way.

        CHAPTER XII: BEEF</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Meat is the name applied to the flesh of all animals used for food. Beef
      is the meat of steer, ox, or cow, and is the most nutritious and largely
      consumed of all animal foods. Meat is chiefly composed of the albuminoids
      (fibrin, albumen, gelatin), fat, mineral matter, and water.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Fibrin</strong> is that substance in blood which causes it to
      coagulate when shed. It consists of innumerable delicate fibrils which
      entangle the blood corpuscles, and form with them a mass called blood
      clot. Fibrin is insoluble in both cold and hot water.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Albumen</strong> is a substance found in the blood and muscle. It
      is soluble in cold water, and is coagulated by hot water or heat. It
      begins to coagulate at 134° F. and becomes solid at 160° F. Here lies the
      necessity of cooking meat in hot water at a low temperature; of broiling
      meat at a high temperature, to quickly sear surface.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Gelatin</strong> in its raw state is termed <em>collagen</em>. It
      is a transparent, tasteless substance, obtained by boiling with water,
      muscle, skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, ligament, or membrane of animals.
      By this process, collagen of connective tissues is dissolved and converted
      into gelatin. Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, soluble in hot water,
      but in boiling water is decomposed, and by much boiling will not solidify
      on cooling. When subjected to cold water it swells, and is called hydrated
      gelatin. Myosin is the albuminoid of muscle, collagen of tendons, ossein
      of bones, and chondrin of cartilage and gristle.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Gelatin, although highly nitrogenous, does not act in the system as other
      nitrogenous foods, as a large quantity passes out unchanged.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span><strong>Fat</strong> is the
      white or yellowish oily solid substance forming the chief part of the
      adipose tissue. Fat is found in thick layers directly under the skin, in
      other parts of the body, in bone, and is intermingled throughout the
      flesh. Fat as food is a great heat-giver and force-producer.
      <em>Suet</em> is the name given to fat which lies about the loins and
      kidneys. Beef suet tried out and clarified is much used in cookery for
      shortening and frying.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Mineral Matter.</strong> The largest amount of mineral matter is
      found in bone. It is principally calcium phosphate (phosphate of lime).
      Sodium chloride (common salt) is found in the blood and throughout the
      tissues.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Water</strong> abounds in all animals, constituting a large
      percentage of their weight.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The color of meat is due to the coloring matter (hæmoglobin) which abounds
      in the red corpuscles of the blood.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The distinctive flavor of meat is principally due to peptones and allied
      substances, and is intensified by the presence of sodium chloride and
      other salts.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The beef creature is divided by splitting through the backbone in two
      parts, each part being called <em>a side of beef</em>. Four hundred and
      fifty pounds is good market weight for a side of beef.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The most expensive cuts come from that part of the creature where muscles
      are but little used, which makes the meat finer-grained and consequently
      more tender, taking less time for cooking. Many of the cheapest cuts,
      though equally nutritious, need long, slow cooking to render them tender
      enough to digest easily. Tough meat which has long and coarse fibres is
      often found to be very juicy, on account of the greater motion of that
      part of the creature, which causes the juices to flow freely. Roasting and
      broiling, which develop so fine a flavor, can only be applied to the more
      expensive cuts. The liver, kidneys, and heart are of firm, close texture,
      and difficult of digestion. Tripe, which is the first stomach of the ox,
      is easy of digestion, but on account of the large amount of fat which it
      contains, it is undesirable for those of weak digestion.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The quality of beef depends on age of the creature and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>manner of feeding. The best
      beef is obtained from a steer of four or five years. Good beef should be
      firm and of fine-grained texture, bright red in color, and well mottled
      and coated with fat. The fat should be firm and of a yellowish color. Suet
      should be dry, and crumble easily. Beef should not be eaten as soon as
      killed, but allowed to hang and ripen,—from two to three weeks in winter,
      and two weeks in summer.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Meat should be removed from paper as soon as it comes from market,
      otherwise paper absorbs some of the juices.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Meat should be kept in a cool place. In winter, beef may be bought in
      large quantities and cut as needed. If one chooses, a loin or rump may be
      bought and kept by the butcher, who sends cuts as ordered.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Always wipe beef, before cooking, with a cheese-cloth wrung out of cold
      water, but never allow it to stand in a pan of cold water, as juices will
      be drawn out.

      The Effect of Different Temperatures on the Cooking of Meat
    </h3>
    <p class="c019">
      By putting meat in cold water and allowing water to heat gradually, a
      large amount of juice is extracted and meat is tasteless; and by long
      cooking the connective tissues are softened and dissolved, which gives to
      the stock when cold a jelly-like consistency. This principle applies to
      soup making.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      By putting meat in boiling water, allowing the water to boil for a few
      minutes, then lowering the temperature, juices in the outer surface are
      quickly coagulated, and the inner juices are prevented from escaping. This
      principle applies where nutriment and flavor is desired in meat. Examples:
      boiled mutton, fowl.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      By putting in cold water, bringing quickly to the boiling-point, then
      lowering the temperature and cooking slowly until meat is tender, some of
      the goodness will be in the stock, but a large portion left in the meat.
      Examples: fowl, when cooked to use for made-over dishes, Scotch Broth.

    <h3 class="c018">Broiled Beefsteak</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, cross-cut of
      rump steaks, and second and third cuts from top
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>of round. Porterhouse and
      sirloin cuts are the most expensive, on account of the great loss in bone
      and fat, although price per pound is about the same as for cross-cut of
      rump. Round steak is very juicy, but, having coarser fibre, is not as
      tender. Steaks should be cut at least an inch thick, and from that to two
      and one-half inches. The flank end of sirloin steak should be removed
      before cooking. It may be put in soup kettle, or lean part may be chopped
      and utilized for meat cakes, fat tried out and clarified for shortening.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Broil Steak.</strong> Wipe with a cloth wrung out of cold
      water, and trim off superfluous fat. With some of the fat grease a wire
      broiler, place meat in broiler (having fat edge next to handle), and broil
      over a clear fire, turning every ten seconds for the first minute, that
      surface may be well seared, thus preventing escape of juices. After the
      first minute, turn occasionally until well cooked on both sides. Steak cut
      one inch thick will take five minutes, if liked rare; six minutes, if well
      done. Remove to hot platter, spread with butter, and sprinkle with salt
      and pepper.

    <h3 class="c018">Roast Beef</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The best cuts of beef for roasting are: tip or middle of sirloin, back of
      rump, or first three ribs. Tip of sirloin roast is desirable for a small
      family. Back of rump makes a superior roast for a large family, and is
      more economical than sirloin. It is especially desirable where a large
      quantity of dish gravy is liked, for in carving the meat juices follow the
      knife. Rib roasts contain more fat than either of the others, and are
      somewhat cheaper.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Roast Beef.</strong> Wipe, put on a rack in dripping-pan, skin
      side down, rub over with salt, and dredge meat and pan with flour. Place
      in hot oven, that the surface may be quickly seared, thus preventing
      escape of inner juices. After flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and
      baste with fat which has tried out; if meat is quite lean, it may be
      necessary to put trimmings of fat in pan. Baste every ten minutes; if this
      rule is followed, meat will be found more juicy. When meat is about half
      done, turn it over and dredge with flour, that skin side may be uppermost
      for final browning. For roasting, consult Time Table for Baking Meats,
      page <a href="#Page_30" class="pginternal">30</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      If there is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small quantity of water;
      this, however, is not desirable, and seldom need be done if size of pan is
      adapted to size of roast. Beef to be well roasted should be started in hot
      oven and heat decreased, so that when carved the slices will be red
      throughout, with a crisp layer of golden brown fat on the top.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>Beef roasted when temperature
      is so high that surface is hardened before heat can penetrate to the
      centre is most unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Sirloin or rib roasts may have the bones removed, and be rolled, skewered,
      and tied in shape. Chicago Butt is cut from the most tender part of back
      of rump. They are shipped from Chicago, our greatest beef centre, and if
      fresh and from a heavy creature, make excellent roasts at a small price.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Roast Beef Gravy.</strong> Remove some of the fat from pan,
      leaving four tablespoons. Place on front of range, add four tablespoons
      flour, and stir until well browned. The flour, dredged and browned in pan,
      should give additional color to gravy. Add gradually one and one-half cups
      boiling water, cook five minutes, season with salt and pepper, and strain.
      If flour should burn in pan, gravy will be full of black particles.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Carve a Roast of Beef.</strong> Have roast placed on platter
      skin side up; with a pointed, thin-bladed, sharp knife cut a sirloin or
      rib roast in thin slices at right angles to the ribs, and cut slices from
      ribs. If there is tenderloin, remove it from under the bone, and cut in
      thin slices across grain of meat. Carve back of rump in thin slices with
      the grain of meat; by so doing, some of the least tender muscle will be
      served with that which is tender. By cutting across grain of meat, the
      tenderest portion is sliced by itself, as is the less tender portion.

      The tenderloin of beef which lies under the loin and rump is called fillet
      of beef. The fillet under the loin is known as the long fillet, and when

    <h3 class="c018">Corned Beef</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Corned beef has but little nutritive value. It is used to give variety to
      our diet in summer, when fresh meats prove too stimulating. It is eaten by
      the workingman to give bulk to his food. The best pieces of corned beef
      are the rattle rand and fancy brisket. The fancy brisket commands a higher
      price and may be easily told from the rattle rand by the selvage on lower
      side and the absence of bones. The upper end of brisket (butt end) is
      thick and composed mostly of lean meat, the middle cut has more fat but is
      not well mixed, while the lower (navel end) has a large quantity of fat.
      The rattle rand contains a thick lean end; the second cut contains three
      distinct layers of meat and fat, and is considered the best cut by those
      who prefer meat well streaked with fat. The rattle rand has a thin end,
      which contains but one layer of lean meat and much fat, consequently is
      not a desirable piece.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Boil Corned Beef.</strong> Wipe the meat and tie securely in
      shape, if this has not been already done at market. Put in kettle, cover
      with cold water, and bring slowly to boiling-point. Boil five minutes,
      remove scum, and cook at a lower temperature until tender. Cool slightly
      in water in which it was cooked, remove to a dish, cover, and place on
      cover a weight, that meat may be well pressed. The lean meat and fat may
      be separated and put in alternate layers in a bread pan, then covered and
      pressed.

      water, skim off fat and cook vegetables (with exception of beets, which
      require a long <span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>time for
      cooking) in this water. Carrots require a longer time for cooking than
      cabbage or turnips. Carrots and turnips, if small, may be cooked whole; if
      large, cut in pieces. Cabbage and beets are served in separate dishes,
      other vegetables on same dish with meat.

        CHAPTER XIII: LAMB AND MUTTON</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Lamb is the name given to the meat of lambs; mutton, to the meat of sheep.
      Lamb, coming as it does from the young creature, is immature, and less
      nutritious than mutton. The flesh of mutton ranks with the flesh of beef
      in nutritive value and digestibility. The fat of mutton, on account of its
      larger percentage of stearic acid, is more difficult of digestion than the
      fat of beef.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lamb may be eaten soon after the animal is killed and dressed; mutton must
      hang to ripen. Good mutton comes from a sheep about three years old, and
      should hang from two to three weeks. The English South Down Mutton is cut
      from creatures even older than three years. Young lamb, when killed from
      six weeks to three months old, is called spring lamb, and appears in the
      market as early as the last of January, but is very scarce until March.
      Lamb one year old is called a yearling. Many object to the strong flavor
      of mutton; this is greatly overcome by removing the pink skin and trimming
      off superfluous fat.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lamb and mutton are divided into two parts by cutting through entire
      length of backbone; then subdivided into fore and hind quarter, eight ribs
      being left on hind quarter,—while in beef but three ribs are left on
      hind-quarter. These eight ribs are cut into chops and are known as
      <em>rib chops</em>. The meat which lies between these ribs and the leg,
      cut into chops, is known as <em>loin</em> or <em>kidney chops</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lamb and mutton chops cut from loin have a small piece of tenderloin on
      one side of bone, and correspond to porterhouse steaks in the beef
      creature. Rib chops which have the
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>bone cut short and scraped
      clean, nearly to the lean meat, are called <em>French chops</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>The leg</em> is sold whole for boiling or roasting. The fore-quarter
      may be boned, stuffed, rolled, and roasted, but is more often used for
      broth, stew, or fricassee.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For <em>a saddle of mutton</em> the loin is removed whole before splitting
      the creature. Some of the bones are removed and the flank ends are rolled,
      fastened with wooden skewers, and securely tied to keep skewers in place.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Good quality mutton should be fine-grained and of bright pink color; the
      fat white, hard, and flaky. If the outside skin comes off easily, mutton
      is sure to be good. Lamb chops may be easily distinguished from mutton
      chops by the red color of bone. As lamb grows older, blood recedes from
      bones; therefore in mutton the bone is white. In <em>leg of lamb</em> the
      bone at joint is serrated, while in leg of mutton the bone at joint is
      smooth and rounded. Good mutton contains a larger proportion of fat than
      good beef. Poor mutton is often told by the relatively small proportion of
      fat and lean as compared to bone.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lamb is usually preferred well done; mutton is often cooked rare.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Broiled Lamb or Mutton Chops</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe chops, remove superfluous fat, and place in a broiler greased with
      some of mutton fat. In loin chops, flank may be rolled and fastened with a
      small wooden skewer. Follow directions for Broiling Beefsteak on page
      <a href="#Page_196" class="pginternal">196</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Pan-broiled Chops</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Chops for pan broiling should have flank and most of fat removed. Wipe
      chops and put in hissing hot frying-pan.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Turn as soon as under surface is seared, and sear other side. Turn often,
      using knife and fork that the surface may not be pierced, as would be
      liable if fork alone were used. Cook six minutes if liked rare, eight to
      ten minutes if liked well done. Let stand around edge of frying-pan to
      brown the outside fat. When half cooked, sprinkle with salt. Drain on
      brown paper, put on hot platter, and spread with butter or serve with
      Tomato or Soubise Sauce.

      Wipe and trim chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in crumbs, egg,
      and crumbs, fry in deep fat from five to eight minutes, and drain. Serve
      with Tomato Sauce, or stack around a mound of mashed potatoes, fried
      potato balls, or green peas. Never fry but four at a time, and allow fat
      to reheat between fryings. After testing fat for temperature, put in chops
      and place kettle on back of range, that surface of chops may not be too
      brown while the inside is still underdone.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Chops à la Signora</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Gash French Chops on outer edge, extending cut half-way through lean meat.

      wrap in calf’s caul. Roll in flour, dip in egg, then in stale bread
      crumbs, and sauté in butter eight minutes, turning often. Place in oven
      four minutes to finish cooking. Arrange on hot platter for serving, and
      place on top of each a fresh broiled mushroom or mushroom baked in cream.
      To fat in pan add a small quantity of boiling water and pour around chops.
      This is a delicious way of cooking chops for a dinner party.

        CHAPTER XIV: VEAL</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Veal is the meat obtained from a young calf killed when six to eight weeks
      old. Veal from a younger animal is very unwholesome, and is liable to
      provoke serious gastric disturbances. Veal contains a much smaller
      percentage of fat than beef or mutton, is less nutritious, and (though
      from a young creature) more difficult of digestion. Like lamb, it is not
      improved by long hanging, but should be eaten soon after killing and
      dressing. It should always be remembered that the flesh of young animals
      does not keep fresh as long as that of older ones. Veal is divided in same
      manner as lamb, into fore and hind quarters. The fore-quarter is
      subdivided into breast, shoulder, and neck; the hind-quarter into loin,
      leg, and knuckle. Cutlets, fillets (cushion), and fricandeau are cut from
      the thick part of leg.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Good veal may be known by its pinkish-colored flesh and white fat; when
      the flesh lacks color, it has been taken from a creature which was too
      young to kill for food, or, if of the right age, was bled before killing.
      Veal may be obtained throughout the year, but is in season during the
      spring. Veal should be thoroughly cooked; being deficient in fat and
      having but little flavor, pork or butter should be added while cooking,
      and more seasoning is required than for other meats.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Veal Cutlets</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Use slices of veal from leg cut one-half inch thick. Wipe, remove bone and
      skin, then cut in pieces for serving. The long, irregular-shaped pieces
      may be rolled, and fastened with small wooden skewers. Sprinkle with salt
      and pepper; <span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>dip in flour,
      egg, and crumbs; fry slowly, until well browned, in salt pork fat or
      butter; then remove cutlets to stewpan and pour over one and one-half cups
      Brown Sauce. Place on back of range and cook slowly forty minutes, or
      until cutlets are tender.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Veal may be cooked first in boiling water until tender, then crumbed and
      fried. The water in which veal was cooked may be used for sauce. Arrange
      on hot platter, strain sauce and pour around cutlets, and garnish with
      parsley.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Brown Sauce.</strong> Brown three tablespoons butter, add three
      tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. Add gradually one and
      one-half cups stock or water, or half stock and half stewed and strained
      tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and Worcestershire Sauce.
      The trimmings from veal (including skin and bones) may be covered with one
      and one-half cups cold water, allowed to heat slowly to boiling-point,
      then cooked, strained, and used for sauce.

        CHAPTER XV: SWEETBREADS</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      A sweetbread is the thymus gland of lamb or calf, but in cookery, veal
      sweetbreads only are considered. It is prenatally developed, of unknown
      function, and as soon as calf is taken from liquid food it gradually
      disappears. Pancreas, stomach sweetbread, is sold in some sections of the
      country, but in our markets this custom is not practised. Sweetbreads are
      a reputed table delicacy, and a valuable addition to the menu of the
      convalescent.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      A sweetbread consists of two parts, connected by tubing and membranes. The
      round, compact part is called the heart sweetbread, as its position is
      nearer the heart; the other part is called the throat sweetbread. When
      sweetbread is found in market separated, avoid buying two of the throat
      sweetbreads, as the heart sweetbread is more desirable.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Sweetbreads spoil very quickly. They should be removed from paper as soon
      as received from market, plunged into cold water and allowed to stand one
      hour, drained, and put into acidulated salted boiling water then allowed
      to cook slowly twenty minutes; again drained, and plunged into cold water,
      that they may be kept white and firm. Sweetbreads are always parboiled in
      this manner for subsequent cooking.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Broiled Sweetbread</h3>

        CHAPTER XVI: PORK</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Pork is the flesh and fat of pig or hog. Different parts of the creature,
      when dressed, take different names.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The chine and spareribs, which correspond to the loin in lamb and veal,
      are used for roasts or steaks. Two ribs are left on the chine. The hind
      legs furnish <em>hams</em>. These are cured, salted, and smoked.
      Sugar-cured hams are considered the best. Pickle, to which is added light
      brown sugar, molasses, and saltpetre, is introduced close to bone; hams
      are allowed to hang one week, then smoked with hickory wood.
      <em>Shoulders</em> are usually corned, or salted and smoked, though
      sometimes cooked fresh. <em>Pigs’ feet</em> are boiled until tender,
      split, and covered with vinegar made from white wine. <em>Hocks</em>, the
      part just above the feet, are corned, and much used by Germans.
      <em>Heads</em> are soused, and cooked by boiling. The flank, which lies
      just below the ribs, is salted and smoked, and furnishes <em>bacon</em>.
      The best pieces of fat salt pork come from the back, on either side of
      backbone.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fat, when separated from flesh and membrane, is tried out and called lard.
      <em>Leaf lard</em> is the best, and is tried out from the leaf shaped
      pieces of solid fat which lie inside the flank. <em>Sausages</em> are
      trimmings of lean and fat meat, minced, highly seasoned, and forced into
      thin casings made of the prepared entrails. <em>Little pigs</em> (four
      weeks old) are sometimes killed; dressed, and roasted whole.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Pork contains the largest percentage of fat of any meat. When eaten fresh
      it is the most difficult of digestion, and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>although found in market
      through the entire year, it should be but seldom served, and then only
      during the winter months. By curing, salting, and smoking, pork is
      rendered more wholesome. <em>Bacon</em>, next to butter and cream, is the
      most easily assimilated of all fatty foods.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Pork Chops</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place in a hot frying-pan, and
      cook slowly until tender, and well browned on each side.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Pork Chops with Fried Apples</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Arrange Pork Chops on a platter, and surround with slices of apples, cut

    <h3 class="c018">Roast Pork</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe pork, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place on a rack in a
      dripping-pan, and dredge meat and bottom of pan with flour. Bake in a
      moderate oven three or four hours, basting every fifteen minutes with fat
      in pan. Make a gravy as for other roasts.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Pork Tenderloins with Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe tenderloins, put in a dripping-pan, and brown quickly in a hot oven;
      then sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake forty-five minutes, basting
      every fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Sweet Potatoes.</strong> Pare six potatoes and parboil ten
      minutes, drain, put in pan with meat, and cook until soft, basting when

    <p class="c019">
      Cut fat salt pork in one-fourth inch slices, cut gashes one-third inch
      apart in slices, nearly to rind. Try out in a hot frying-pan until brown
      and crisp, occasionally turning off fat from pan. Serve around strips of
      codfish which have been soaked in pan of lukewarm water and allowed to
      stand on back of range until soft. Serve with Drawn Butter Sauce, boiled
      potatoes, and beets.

      Wipe ham, remove one-half outside layer of fat, and place in frying-pan.
      Cover with tepid water and let stand on back of range thirty minutes;
      drain, and dry on a towel. Heat pan, put in ham, brown quickly on one
      side, turn and brown other side; or soak ham over night, dry, and cook in
      hot frying-pan. If cooked too long, ham will become hard and dry. Serve
      with fried eggs cooked in the dried-out ham fat.

      teaspoons mustard, one-half teaspoon sugar, and one-eighth teaspoon
      paprika. When thoroughly heated pour over ham and serve at once.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Ham</h3>

      for Cooking, page <a href="#Page_28" class="pginternal">28</a>. Remove
      kettle from range and set aside, that ham may partially cool; then take
      from water, remove outside skin, sprinkle with sugar and fine cracker
      crumbs, and stick with cloves one-half inch apart. Bake one hour in a slow
      oven. Serve cold, thinly sliced.

      Serve with fried apples. Sausages are often broiled same as bacon and
      apples baked in pan under them.

    <h3 class="c018">Boston Baked Beans</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Pick over one quart pea beans, cover with cold water, and soak over night.
      In morning, drain, cover with fresh water, heat slowly (keeping water
      below boiling-point), and cook until skins will burst,—which is best
      determined by taking a few beans on the tip of a spoon and blowing on
      them, when skins will burst if sufficiently cooked. Beans thus tested
      must, of course, be thrown away. Drain beans, throwing bean-water out of
      doors, not in sink. Scald rind of three-fourths pound fat salt pork,
      scrape, remove one-fourth inch slice and put in bottom of bean-pot. Cut
      through rind of remaining pork every one-half inch, making cuts one inch
      deep. Put beans in pot and bury pork in beans, leaving rind exposed. Mix
      one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon molasses, and three tablespoons sugar;
      add one cup boiling water, and pour over beans; then add enough more
      boiling water to cover beans. Cover bean-pot, put in oven, and bake slowly
      six or eight hours, uncovering the last hour of
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>cooking, that rind may become
      brown and crisp. Add water as needed. Many feel sure that by adding with
      seasonings one-half tablespoon mustard, the beans are more easily
      digested. If pork mixed with lean is preferred, use less salt.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The fine reputation which Boston Baked Beans have gained has been
      attributed to the earthen bean-pot with small top and bulging sides in
      which they are supposed to be cooked. Equally good beans have often been
      eaten where a five-pound lard pail was substituted for the broken
      bean-pot.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Yellow-eyed beans are very good when baked.</p>

        CHAPTER XVII: POULTRY AND GAME</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Poultry includes all domestic birds suitable for food except pigeon and
      squab. Examples: chicken, fowl, turkey, duck, goose, etc. Game includes
      such birds and animals suitable for food as are pursued and taken in field
      and forest. Examples: quail, partridge, wild duck, plover, deer, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The flesh of chicken, fowl, and turkey has much shorter fibre than that of
      ruminating animals, and is not intermingled with fat,—the fat always being
      found in layers directly under the skin, and surrounding the intestines.
      Chicken, fowl, and turkey are nutritious, and chicken is specially easy of
      digestion. The white meat found on breast and wing is more readily
      digested than the dark meat. The legs, on account of constant motion, are
      of a coarser fibre and darker color.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Since incubators have been so much used for hatching chickens, small birds
      suitable for broiling may be always found in market. Chickens which appear
      in market during January weighing about one and one-half pounds are called
      <em>spring chickens</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fowl is found in market throughout the year, but is at its best from March
      until June.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Philadelphia, until recently, furnished our market with Philadelphia
      chickens and <em>capons</em>, but now Massachusetts furnishes equally good
      ones, which are found in market from December to June. They are very
      large, plump, and superior eating. At an early age they are deprived of
      the organs of reproduction, penned, and specially fatted for killing.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>They are recognized by the
      presence of head, tail, and wing feathers.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Turkeys are found in market throughout the year, but are best during the
      winter months. Tame ducks and geese are very indigestible on account of
      the large quantity of fat they contain. Goose meat is thoroughly
      infiltrated with fat, containing sometimes forty to forty-five per cent.
      Pigeons, being old birds, need long, slow cooking to make them tender.
      Squabs (young pigeons) make a delicious tidbit for the convalescent, and
      are often the first meat allowed a patient by the physician.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The flesh of game, with the exception of wild duck and wild geese, is
      tender, contains less fat than poultry, is of fine though strong flavor,
      and easy of digestion. Game meat is usually of dark color, partridge and
      quail being exceptions, and is usually cooked rare. Venison, the flesh of
      deer, is short-fibred, dark-colored, highly savored, tender, and easy of
      digestion; being highly savored, it often disagrees with those of weak
      digestion.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Geese are in market throughout the year; Massachusetts and Rhode Island
      furnishing specially good ones. A goose twelve weeks old is known as a
      <em>green goose</em>. They may be found in market from May to September.
      Young geese which appear in market September first and continue through
      December are called <em>goslings</em>. They have been hatched during May
      and June, and then fatted for market.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Young ducks, found in market about March first, are called
      <em>ducklings</em>. Canvasback Ducks have gained a fine reputation
      throughout the country, and are found in market from the last of November
      until March. Redhead Ducks are in season two weeks earlier, and are about
      as good eating as Canvasback Ducks, and much less in price. The
      distinctive flavor of both is due to the wild celery on which they feed.
      Many other kinds of ducks are found in market during the fall and winter.
      Examples: Widgeon, Mallard, Lake Erie Teal, Black Ducks, and Butterballs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fresh quail are in market from October fifteenth to January first, the law
      forbidding their being killed at any other time in the year. The same is
      true of partridge, but both
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>are frozen and kept in cold
      storage several months. California sends frozen quail in large numbers to
      Eastern markets. Grouse (<em>prairie chicken</em>) are always
      obtainable,—fresh ones in the fall; later, those kept in cold storage.
      Plover may be bought from April until December.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Select Poultry and Game.</strong> A <em>chicken</em> is known
      by soft feet, smooth skin, and soft cartilage at end of breastbone. An
      abundance of pinfeathers always indicates a young bird, while the presence
      of long hairs denotes age. In a <em>fowl</em> the feet have become hard
      and dry with coarse scales, and cartilage at end of breastbone has
      ossified. <em>Cock turkeys</em> are usually better eating than hen
      turkeys, unless hen turkey is young, small, and plump. A good turkey
      should be plump, have smooth dark legs, and cartilage at end of breastbone
      soft and pliable. Good geese abound in pinfeathers. Small birds should be
      plump, have soft feet and pliable bills.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Dress and Clean Poultry.</strong> Remove hairs and down by
      holding the bird over a flame (from gas, alcohol, or burning paper) and
      constantly changing position until all parts of surface have been exposed
      to flame; this is known as <em>singeing</em>. Cut off the head and draw
      out pinfeathers, using a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin around
      the leg one and one-half inches below the leg joint, care being taken not
      to cut tendons; place leg at this cut over edge of board, press downward
      to snap the bone, then take foot in right hand, holding bird firmly in
      left hand, and pull off foot, and with it the tendons. In old birds the
      tendons must be drawn separately, which is best accomplished by using a
      steel skewer. Make an incision through skin below breastbone, just large
      enough to admit the hand. With the hand remove entrails, gizzard, heart,
      and liver; the last three named constitute what is known as
      <em>giblets</em>. The gall-bladder, lying on the under surface of the
      right lobe of the liver, is removed with liver, and great care must be
      taken that it is not broken, as a small quantity of the bile which it
      contains would impart a bitter flavor to the parts with which it came in
      contact. Enclosed by the ribs, on either side of backbone, may be found
      the lungs, of spongy consistency and red color. Care must be taken that
      every part of them is removed. Kidneys,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>lying in the hollow near end
      of backbone, must also be removed. By introducing first two fingers under
      skin close to neck, the windpipe may be easily found and withdrawn; also
      the crop, which will be found adhering to skin close to breast. Draw down
      neck skin, and cut off neck close to body, leaving skin long enough to
      fasten under the back. Remove oil bag, and wash bird by allowing cold
      water to run through it, not allowing bird to soak in cold water. Wipe
      inside and outside, looking carefully to see that everything has been
      withdrawn. If there is disagreeable odor, suggesting that fowl may have
      been kept too long, clean at once, wash inside and out with soda water,
      and sprinkle inside with charcoal and place some under wings.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Poultry dressed at market seldom have tendons removed unless so ordered.
      It is always desirable to have them withdrawn, as they become hard and
      bony during cooking. It is the practice of market-men to cut a gash
      through the skin, to easier reach crop and windpipe. This gash must be
      sewed before stuffing, and causes the bird to look less attractive when
      cooked.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Cut up a Fowl.</strong> Singe, draw out pinfeathers, cut off
      head, remove tendons and oil bag. Cut through skin between leg and body
      close to body, bend back leg (thus breaking ligaments), cut through flesh,
      and separate at joint. Separate the upper part of leg,
      <em>second joint</em>, from lower part of leg, <em>drumstick</em>, as leg
      is separated from body. Remove wing by cutting through skin and flesh
      around upper wing joint which lies next to body, then disjoint from body.
      Cut off tip of wing and separate wing at middle joint. Remove leg and wing
      from other side. Separate breast from back by cutting through skin,
      beginning two inches below breastbone and passing knife between terminus
      of small ribs on either side and extending cut to collar-bone. Before
      removing entrails, gizzard, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, and
      windpipe, observe their position, that the anatomy of the bird may be
      understood. The back is sometimes divided by cutting through the middle
      crosswise. The wishbone, with adjoining meat, is frequently removed, and
      the breast meat may be separated in two parts by cutting through flesh
      close to <span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>breastbone with
      cleaver. Wipe pieces, excepting back, with cheese-cloth wrung out of cold
      water. Back piece needs thorough washing.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Clean Giblets.</strong> Remove thin membrane, arteries, veins,
      and clotted blood around heart. Separate gall-bladder from liver, cutting
      off any of liver that may have a greenish tinge. Cut fat and membranes
      from gizzard. Make a gash through thickest part of gizzard, and cut as far
      as inner lining, being careful not to pierce it. Remove the inner sack and
      discard. Wash giblets and cook until tender, with neck and tips of wings,
      putting them in cold water and heating water quickly that some of the
      flavor may be drawn out into stock, which is to be used for making gravy.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Stuff Poultry.</strong> Put stuffing by spoonfuls in neck end,
      using enough to sufficiently fill the skin, that bird may look plump when
      served. Where cracker stuffing is used, allowance must be made for the
      swelling of crackers, otherwise skin may burst during cooking. Put
      remaining stuffing in body; if the body is full, sew skin; if not full,
      bring skin together with a skewer.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Truss Fowl.</strong> Draw thighs close to body and hold by
      inserting a steel skewer under middle joint running it through body,
      coming out under middle joint on other side. Cut piece three-fourths inch
      wide from neck skin, and with it fasten legs together at ends; or cross
      drumsticks, tie securely with a long string, and fasten to tail. Place
      wings close to body and hold them by inserting a second skewer through
      wing, body, and wing on opposite side. Draw neck skin under back and
      fasten with a small wooden skewer. Turn bird on its breast. Cross string
      attached to tail piece and draw it around each end of lower skewer; again
      cross string and draw around each end of upper skewer; fasten string in a
      knot and cut off ends. In birds that are not stuffed legs are often passed
      through incisions cut in body under bones near tail.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Dress Birds for Broiling.</strong> Singe, wipe, and with a
      sharp-pointed knife, beginning at back of neck, make a cut through
      backbone the entire length of bird. Lay open the bird and remove contents
      from inside. Cut out rib bones
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>on either side of backbone,
      remove from breastbone, then cut through tendons at joints.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Fillet a Chicken.</strong> Remove skin from breast, and with a
      small sharp knife begin at end of collar-bone and cut through flesh,
      following close to wish and breast bones the entire length of meat. Raise
      flesh with fingers, and with knife free the piece of meat from bones which
      lie under it. Cut meat away from wing joint; this solid piece of breast is
      meat known as a <em>fillet</em>. This meat is easily separated in two
      parts. The upper, larger part is called the <em>large fillet</em>; the
      lower part the <em>mignon fillet</em>. The tough skin on the outside of
      large fillet should be removed, also the sinew from mignon fillet. To
      remove tough skin, place large fillet on a board, upper side down, make an
      incision through flesh at top of fillet, and cut entire length of fillet,
      holding knife as close to skin as possible. Trim edges, that fillet may
      look shapely.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Broiled Chicken</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Dress for broiling, following directions on page
      <a href="#Page_244" class="pginternal">244</a>. Sprinkle with salt and
      pepper, and place in a well-greased broiler. Broil twenty minutes over a
      clear fire, watching carefully and turning broiler so that all parts may
      be equally browned. The flesh side must be exposed to the fire the greater
      part of time, as the skin side will brown quickly. Remove to a hot
      platter, spread with soft butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
      Chickens are so apt to burn while broiling that many prefer to partially
      cook in oven. Place chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down, sprinkle with
      salt and pepper, dot over with butter, and bake fifteen minutes in hot
      oven; then broil to finish cooking. <em>Guinea chickens</em> are becoming
      popular cooked in this way.

    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Fowl</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Dress, clean, and truss a four-pound fowl, tie in cheese-cloth, place on
      trivet in a kettle, half surround with boiling water, cover, and cook
      slowly until tender, turning occasionally. Add salt the last hour of
      cooking. Serve with Egg, Oyster, or Celery Sauce. It is not desirable to
      stuff a boiled fowl.

      tablespoons each butter and flour cooked together. Add to sauce one-half
      cup each of cooked carrot (cut in fancy shapes) and green peas, one
      teaspoon lemon juice, yolks two eggs, salt and pepper. Place chicken on
      hot platter, surround with sauce, and sprinkle chicken and sauce with
      one-half tablespoon finely chopped parsley.

    <h3 class="c018">Stewed Chicken with Onions</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Dress, clean, and cut in pieces for serving, two chickens. Cook in a small
      quantity of water with eighteen tiny young onions. Remove chicken to
      serving dish as soon as tender, and when onions are soft drain from stock
      and reduce stock to one and one-half cups. Make sauce of three tablespoons
      butter, four tablespoons flour, stock, and one-half cup heavy cream; then
      add yolks three eggs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Pour sauce
      over chicken and onions.

      Melt one-fourth cup butter, add one large onion thinly sliced, and two
      broilers cut in pieces for serving; cover, and cook slowly ten minutes;
      then add one cup Chicken Stock, and cook until meat is tender. Remove
      chickens, rub stock and onions through a sieve, and add one and one-half
      tablespoons each butter and flour cooked together. Add cream to make sauce
      of the right consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken on

      two cloves of garlic finely chopped, the chicken, and boiling water to
      cover. Cook until chicken is tender. Remove to serving dish, and thicken
      sauce with three tablespoons each butter and flour cooked together; there
      should be one and one-half cups sauce. Canned pimentoes may be used in
      place of red peppers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Roast Chicken</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Dress, clean, stuff, and truss a chicken. Place on its back on rack in a
      dripping-pan, rub entire surface with salt, and spread breast and legs
      with three tablespoons butter, rubbed until creamy and mixed with two
      tablespoons flour. Dredge bottom of pan with flour. Place in a hot oven,
      and when flour is well browned, reduce the heat, then baste. Continue
      basting every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For basting, use
      one-fourth cup butter, melted in two-thirds cup boiling water, and after
      this is gone, use fat in pan, and when necessary to prevent flour burning,
      add one cup boiling water. During cooking, turn chicken frequently, that
      it may brown evenly. If a thick crust is desired, dredge bird with flour
      two or three times during cooking. If a glazed surface is preferred,
      spread bird with butter, omitting flour, and do not dredge during baking.
      When breast meat is tender, bird is sufficiently cooked. A four-pound
      chicken requires about one and one-half hours.

    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      A goose, having short legs, is trussed differently from chicken, fowl, and
      turkey. After inserting skewers, wind string twice around one leg bone,
      then around other leg bone, having one inch space of string between legs.
      Draw legs with both ends of string close to back, cross string under back,
      then fasten around skewers and tie in a knot.

      hot oven, basting every five minutes with fat in pan; cut string and
      remove string and skewers. Serve with Orange or Olive Sauce. Currant jelly
      should accompany a duck course. Domestic ducks should always be well
      cooked, requiring little more than twice the time allowed for wild ducks.

      Ducks are sometimes stuffed with apples, pared, cored, and cut in
      quarters, or three small onions may be put in body of duck to improve
      flavor. Neither apples nor onions are to be served. If a stuffing to be
      eaten is desired, cover pieces of dry bread with boiling water; as soon as
      bread has absorbed water, press out the water; season bread with salt,
      pepper, melted butter, finely chopped onion, or use

        CHAPTER XVIII: FISH AND MEAT SAUCES</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      The French chef keeps always on hand four sauces,—White, Brown, Béchamel,
      and Tomato,—and with these as a basis is able to make kinds innumerable.
      Butter and flour are usually cooked together for thickening sauces. When
      not browned, it is called <i><span lang="fr">roux</span></i
      >; when browned, <em>brown roux</em>. The French mix butter and flour
      together, put in saucepan, place over fire, stir for five minutes; set
      aside to cool, again place over fire, and add liquid, stirring constantly
      until thick and smooth. Butter and flour for brown sauces are cooked
      together much longer, and watched carefully lest butter should burn. The
      American cook makes sauce by stirring butter in saucepan until melted and
      bubbling, adds flour and continues stirring, then adds liquid, gradually
      stirring or beating until the boiling-point is reached. For Brown Sauce,
      butter should be stirred until well browned; flour should be added and
      stirred with butter until both are browned before the addition of liquid.
      The secret in making a Brown Sauce is to have butter and flour well
      browned before adding liquid.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      It is well worth remembering that a sauce of average thickness is made by
      allowing two tablespoons each of butter and flour to one cup liquid,
      whether it be milk, stock, or tomato. For Brown Sauce a slightly larger
      quantity of flour is necessary, as by browning flour its thickening
      property is lessened, its starch being changed to dextrine. When sauces
      are set away, put a few bits of butter on top to prevent crust from
      forming.

      tomatoes,—eaten uncooked, served separately or combined in salads, help to
      stimulate a flagging appetite, and when dressed with oil furnish
      considerable nutriment.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Beans, and peas when old, should be employed in making purées and soups;
      by so doing, the outer covering of cellulose, so irritating to the
      stomach, is removed.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Care of Vegetables</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after gathering as possible; in
      case they must be kept, spread on bottom of cool, dry, well-ventilated
      cellar, or place in ice-box. Lettuce may be best kept by sprinkling with
      cold water and placing in a tin pail closely covered. Wilted vegetables
      may be freshened by allowing to stand in cold water. Vegetables which
      contain sugar lose some of their sweetness by standing; corn and peas are
      more quickly affected than others. Winter vegetables should be kept in a
      cold, dry place. Beets, carrots, turnips, potatoes, etc.,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_282">282</span>should be put in barrels or
      piled in bins, to exclude as much air as possible. Squash should be
      spread, and needs careful watching; when dark spots appear, cook at once.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In using canned goods, empty contents from can as soon as opened, lest the
      acid therein act on the tin to produce poisonous compounds, and let stand
      one hour, that it may become reoxygenated. Beans, peas, asparagus, etc.,
      should be emptied into a strainer, drained, and cold water poured over
      them and allowed to run through. In using dried vegetables, soak in cold
      water several hours before cooking. A few years ago native vegetables were
      alone sold; but now our markets are largely supplied from the Southern
      States and California, thus allowing us fresh vegetables throughout the
      year.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Cooking of Vegetables</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      A small scrubbing-brush, which may be bought for five cents, and two small
      pointed knives for preparing vegetables should be found in every kitchen.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Vegetables should be washed in cold water, and cooked until soft in
      boiling salted water; if cooked in an uncovered vessel, their color is
      better kept. For peas and beans add salt to water last half hour of
      cooking. Time for cooking the same vegetable varies according to freshness
      and age, therefore time tables for cooking serve only as guides.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Mushrooms and Truffles</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      These are classed among vegetables. Mushrooms, which grow about us
      abundantly, may be easily gathered, and as they contain considerable
      nutriment, should often be found on the table. While there are hundreds of
      varieties, one by a little study may acquaint herself with a dozen or more
      of the most common ones which are valuable as food. Consult W. Hamilton
      Gibson, “Our Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms.” Many might cause illness,
      but only a few varieties of the <em>Amanita</em> family are deadly poison.
      Mushrooms require heat and moisture,—a severe drought or very wet soil
      being unfavorable for their growth. Never gather mushrooms in the vicinity
      of decaying matter. They appear
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>the middle of May, and last
      until frost comes. <em>Campestris</em> is the variety always found in
      market; French canned are of this family. <em>Boleti</em> are dried,
      canned, and sold as <em>cepes</em>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Truffles</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Truffles belong to the same family as mushrooms, and are grown
      underground. France is the most famous field for their production, from
      which country they are exported in tin cans, and are too expensive for
      ordinary use.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Artichokes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      French artichokes, imported throughout the year, are the ones principally
      used. They retail from thirty to forty cents each, and are cheapest and
      best in November, December, and January. Artichokes are appearing in
      market from California and are somewhat cheaper in price than the French
      Artichoke. Jerusalem artichokes are employed for pickling, and can be
      bought for fifteen cents per quart.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Artichokes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cut off stem close to leaves, remove outside bottom leaves, trim
      artichoke, cut off one inch from top of leaves, and with a sharp knife
      remove choke; then tie artichoke with a string to keep its shape. Soak
      one-half hour in cold water. Drain, and cook thirty to forty-five minutes
      in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Remove from water, place upside down
      to drain, then take off string. Serve with Béchamel or Hollandaise Sauce.
      Boiled Artichokes often constitute a course at dinner. Leaves are drawn
      out separately with fingers, dipped in sauce, and fleshy ends only eaten,
      although the bottom is edible. Artichokes may be cut in quarters, cooked,
      drained, and served with Sauce Bearnaise. When prepared in this way they
      are served with mutton.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Fried Artichokes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Sprinkle Boiled Artichokes cut in quarters with salt, pepper, and finely
      chopped parsley. Dip in Batter I, fry in deep fat, and drain. In preparing
      artichokes, trim off tops of leaves closer than when served as Boiled
      Artichokes.

      Remove all leaves and the choke. Trim bottoms in shape, and cook until
      soft in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Serve with Hollandaise or
      Béchamel Sauce.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Stuffed Artichokes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Prepare and cook as Boiled Artichokes, having them slightly underdone.
      Fill with Chicken Force-meat I or II, and bake thirty minutes in a
      moderate oven, basting twice with Thin White Sauce. Remove to serving dish
      and pour around Thin White Sauce.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Asparagus</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Hothouse asparagus is found in market during winter, but is not very
      satisfactory, and is sold for about one dollar per bunch. Oyster Bay
      (white asparagus) appears first of May, and commands a very high price.
      Large and small green stalk asparagus is in season from first of June to
      middle of July, and cheapest the middle of June.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Asparagus</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cut off lower parts of stalks as far down as they will snap, untie
      bunches, wash, remove scales, and retie. Cook in boiling salted water
      fifteen minutes or until soft, leaving tips out of water first ten
      minutes. Drain, remove string, and spread with soft butter, allowing one
      and one-half tablespoons butter to each bunch asparagus. Asparagus is
      often broken or cut in inch pieces for boiling, cooking tips a shorter
      time than stalks.

      with Asparagus in White Sauce.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Beans</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      <em>String Beans</em> that are obtainable in winter come from California;
      natives appear in market the last of June and continue until the last of
      September. There are two varieties, green (pole cranberry being best
      flavored) and yellow (butter bean).
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Shell Beans</em>, including horticultural and sieva, are sold in the
      pod or shelled, five quarts in pod making one quart shelled. They are
      found in market during July and August. Common lima and improved lima
      shell beans are in season in August and September. Dried lima beans are
      procurable throughout the year.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">String Beans</h3>

    <h3 class="c018">Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Brussels sprouts belong to the same family as cabbage, and the small heads
      grow from one to two inches apart,
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_287">287</span>on the axis of the entire
      stem, one root yielding about two quarts. They are imported, and also grow
      in this country, being cheapest and best in December and January.

      pour on gradually one and one-half cups scalded milk; add sprouts and turn
      mixture into a baking-dish. Cover with buttered crumbs and bake in a hot
      oven until crumbs are brown.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Cabbage</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      There are four kinds of cabbage in the market,—drum-head, sugar-loaf,
      Savoy, and purple; and some variety may be found throughout the year. The
      Savoy is best for boiling; drum-head and purple for Cole-Slaw. In buying,
      select heavy cabbages.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Cabbage</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Take off outside leaves, cut in quarters, and remove tough stalk. Soak in
      cold water and cook in an uncovered vessel in boiling salted water, to
      which is added one-fourth teaspoon soda; this prevents disagreeable odor
      during cooking. Cook from thirty minutes to one hour, drain, and serve; or
      chop, and season with butter, salt, and pepper.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Escalloped Cabbage</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cut one-half boiled cabbage in pieces; put in buttered baking-dish,

      crisp, drain, dry between towels, and mix with Cream Salad Dressing.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Hot Slaw</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Slice cabbage as for Cole-Slaw, using one-half cabbage. Heat in a dressing

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Carrots</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Carrots may always be found in market. New carrots appear last of April,
      and are sold in bunches; these may be boiled and served, but carrots are
      chiefly used for flavoring soups, and for garnishing, on account of their
      bright color. To prepare carrots for cooking, wash and scrape, as best
      flavor and brightest color are near the skin.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Carrots and Peas</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash, scrape, and cut young carrots in small cubes or fancy shapes; cook

    <h3 class="c018">Cauliflower</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cauliflowers comprise the stalks and flowerets of a plant which belongs to
      the same family as Brussels sprouts and cabbage; they may be obtained
      throughout the year, but are cheapest and best in September and October.
      In selecting cauliflowers, choose those with white heads and fresh green
      leaves; if dark spots are on the heads, they are not fresh.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Creamed Cauliflower</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove leaves, cut off stalk, and soak thirty minutes (head down) in cold
      water to cover. Cook (head up) twenty minutes or until soft in boiling
      salted water; drain, separate flowerets, and reheat in one and one-half
      cups White Sauce I.

    <h3 class="c018">Cauliflower à la Huntington</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Prepare cauliflower as for boiled cauliflower, and steam until soft.
      Separate in pieces and pour over the following sauce:
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Mix one and one-half teaspoons mustard, one and one-fourth teaspoons salt,
      one teaspoon powdered sugar, and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_290">290</span>one-fourth teaspoon paprika.
      Add yolks three eggs slightly beaten, one-fourth cup olive oil, and
      one-half cup vinegar in which one-half teaspoon finely chopped shallot has
      infused five minutes. Cook over hot water until mixture thickens. Remove
      from range, and add one-half tablespoon curry powder, two tablespoons
      melted butter, and one teaspoon finely chopped parsley.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Celery</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Celery may be obtained from last of July until April. It is best and
      cheapest in December. Celery stalks are green while growing; but the white
      celery seen in market has been bleached, with the exception of Kalamazoo
      variety, which grows white. To prepare celery for table, cut off roots and
      leaves, separate stalks, wash, scrape, and chill in ice-water. By adding a
      slice of lemon to ice-water celery is kept white and made crisp. If tops
      of stalks are gashed several times before putting in water, they will curl
      back and make celery look more attractive.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Celery in White Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash, scrape, and cut celery stalks in one-inch pieces; cook twenty
      minutes or until soft in boiling salted water; drain, and to two cups
      celery add one cup White Sauce I. This is a most satisfactory way of using
      the outer stalks of celery.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Fried Celery, Tomato Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash and scrape celery, cut in three-inch pieces, dip in batter, fry in

    <p class="c019">
      Chiccory or endive may be obtained throughout the year, but during
      January, February, March, and April supply is imported. It is used only
      for salads.

    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Corn may be found in market from first of June to first of October. Until
      native corn appears it is the most unsatisfactory vegetable. Native corn
      is obtainable the last of July, but is most abundant and cheapest in
      August. Among the best varieties are Crosby for early corn and Evergreen
      for late corn.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Green Corn</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove husks and silky threads. Cook ten to twenty minutes in boiling

    <h3 class="c018">Cucumbers</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cucumbers may be obtained throughout the year, and are generally served
      raw. During the latter part of the summer they are gathered and pickled
      for subsequent use. Small pickled cucumbers are called gherkins.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Sliced Cucumbers</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove thick slices from both ends and cut off a thick paring, as the
      cucumber contains a bitter principle, a large quantity of which lies near
      the skin and stem end. Cut in thin slices and keep in cold water until
      ready to serve. Drain, and cover with crushed ice for serving.

    <h3 class="c018">Greens</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Hothouse beet greens and dandelions appear in market the first of March,
      when they command a high price. Those grown out of doors are in season
      from middle of May to first of July.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Beet Greens</h3>

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Lettuce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Lettuce is obtainable all the year, and is especially valuable during the
      winter and spring, when other green vegetables in market command a high
      price. Although containing but little nutriment, it is useful for the
      large quantity of water and potash salts that it contains, and assists in
      stimulating the appetite. Curly lettuce is of less value than Tennis Ball,
      but makes an effective garnish.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Lettuce should be separated by removing leaves from stalk (discarding
      wilted outer leaves), washed, kept in cold water until crisp, drained, and
      so placed on a towel that water may drop from leaves. A bag made from
      white mosquito netting is useful for drying lettuce. Wash lettuce
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>leaves, place in bag, and
      hang in lower part of ice-box to drain. Wire baskets are used for the same
      purpose. Arrange lettuce for serving in nearly its original shape.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Leeks on Toast</h3>
    <p class="c019">

      with salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Onions</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      The onion belongs to the same family (Lily) as do <em>shallot</em>,
      <em>garlic</em>, <em>leek</em>, and <em>chive</em>. Onions are cooked and
      served as a vegetable. They are wholesome, and contain considerable
      nutriment, but are objectionable on account of the strong odor they impart
      to the breath, due to volatile substances absorbed by the blood, and by
      the blood carried to the lungs, where they are set free. The common garden
      onion is obtainable throughout the year, the new ones appearing in market
      about the first of June. In large centres Bermuda and Spanish onions are
      procurable from March 1st to June 1st, and are of delicate flavor.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Shallot, leek, garlic, and chive are principally used to give additional
      flavor to food. Shallot, garlic, and chive are used, to some extent, in
      making salads.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Onions</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Put onions in cold water and remove skins while under water. Drain, put in

      <h3 class="c018">Parsnips</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Parsnips are not so commonly served as other vegetables; however, they
      often accompany a boiled dinner. They are raised mostly for feeding
      cattle. Unless young they contain a large amount of woody fibre, which
      extends through centre of roots and makes them undesirable as food.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Parsnips with Drawn Butter Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash and scrape parsnips, and cut in pieces two inches long and one-half

      roll in flour, and sauté in butter.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Peas</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Peas contain, next to beans, the largest percentage of proteid of any of
      the vegetables, and when young are easy of digestion. They appear in
      market as early as April, coming from Florida and California, and although
      high in price are hardly worth buying, having been picked so long. Native
      peas may be obtained the middle of June, and last until the first of
      September. The early June are small peas, contained in a small pod.
      McLean, the best peas, are small peas in large flat pods. Champion peas
      are large, and the pods are well filled, but they lack sweetness.
      Marrowfat peas are the largest in the market, and are usually sweet.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Peas</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let stand one-half hour.
      Skim off undeveloped peas which rise to top of water, and drain remaining
      peas. Cook until soft in a small quantity of boiling water, adding salt
      the last fifteen <span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>minutes of
      cooking. (Consult Time Table for Cooking, p.
      <a href="#Page_28" class="pginternal">28</a>). There should be but little,
      if any, water to drain from peas when they are cooked. Season with butter,
      salt, and pepper. If peas have lost much of their natural sweetness, they
      are improved by the addition of a small amount of sugar.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Creamed Peas</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Drain Boiled Peas, and to two cups peas add three-fourths cup White Sauce
      II. Canned peas are often drained, rinsed, and reheated in this way.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Pea Timbales</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Drain and rinse one can peas, and rub through a sieve. To one cup pea pulp
      add two beaten eggs, two tablespoons melted butter, two-thirds teaspoon
      salt, one-eighth teaspoon pepper, few grains cayenne, and few drops onion
      juice. Turn into buttered moulds, set in pan of hot water, cover with
      buttered paper, and bake until firm. Serve with one cup white sauce to

    <p class="c019">
      Radishes may be obtained throughout the year. There are round and long
      varieties, the small round ones being considered best. They are bought in
      bunches, six or seven constituting a bunch. Radishes are used merely for a
      relish, and are served uncooked. To prepare radishes for table, remove
      leaves, stems, and tip end of root, scrape roots, and serve on crushed
      ice. Round radishes look very attractive cut to imitate tulips, when they
      should not be scraped; to accomplish this, begin at root end and make six
      incisions through skin running three-fourths length of radish. Pass knife
      under sections of skin, and cut down as far as incisions extend. Place in
      cold water, and sections of skin will fold back, giving radish a
      tulip-like appearance.

    <h3 class="c018">Spinach</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Spinach is cheapest and best in early summer, but is obtainable throughout

      expensive and of inferior quality.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Spinach</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove roots, carefully pick over (discarding wilted leaves), and wash in
      several waters to be sure that it is free from all sand. When young and
      tender put in a stewpan, allow to heat gradually, and boil twenty-five
      minutes, or until tender, in its own juices. Old spinach is better cooked
      in boiling salted water, allowing two quarts water to one peck spinach.
      Drain thoroughly, chop finely, reheat, and season with butter, salt, and
      pepper. Mound on a serving dish and garnish with slices of “hard-boiled”
      eggs and toast points. The green color of spinach is better retained by

      and yellow crook-neck. Some of the winter varieties appear in market as
      early as the middle of August; among the most common are Marrow, Turban,
      and Hubbard. Turban and Hubbard are usually drier than Marrow. Marrow and
      Turban have a thin shell, which may be pared off before cooking. Hubbard
      Squash has a very hard shell, which must be split in order to separate
      squash in pieces, and squash then cooked in the shell. In selecting winter
      squash, see that it is heavy in proportion to its size.

    <p class="c019">
      Tomatoes are obtainable throughout the year, but are cheapest and best in
      September. Hothouse tomatoes are in market during the winter, and command
      a very high price, sometimes retailing for one and one-half dollars a
      pound.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Southern tomatoes appear as early as May 1st, and although of good color,
      lack flavor. Of the many varieties of tomatoes, Acme is among the best.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Sliced Tomatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, and cover with boiling water; let stand one minute, when they may be

    <p class="c009">Scalloped Tomatoes</p>
    <p class="c009">
      Remove contents from one can tomatoes and drain tomatoes from some of
      their liquor. Season with salt, pepper, a few drops of onion juice, and
      sugar if preferred sweet. Cover the bottom of a buttered baking-dish with
      buttered cracker crumbs, cover with tomatoes, and sprinkle top thickly
      with buttered crumbs. Bake in a hot oven until crumbs are brown.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Broiled Tomatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe and cut in halves crosswise, cut off a thin slice from rounding part
      of each half. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in crumbs, egg, and
      crumbs again, place in a well-buttered broiler, and broil six to eight
      minutes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Tomatoes à la Crême</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, peel, and slice three tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper,

      Turnips are best during the fall and winter; towards spring they become
      corky, and are then suitable only for stews and flavoring. The Ruta-baga,
      a large yellow turnip, is one of the best varieties; the large white

      Potatoes stand pre-eminent among the vegetables used for food. They are
      tubers belonging to the Nightshade family; their hardy growth renders them
      easy of cultivation in almost any soil or climate, and, resisting early
      frosts, they may be raised in a higher latitude than the cereals.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      They give needed bulk to food rather than nutriment, and, lacking in
      proteid, should be used in combination with meat, fish, or eggs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Potatoes contain an acrid juice, the greater part of which lies near the
      skin; it passes into the water during boiling of potatoes, and escapes
      with the steam from a baked potato.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Potatoes are best in the fall, and keep well through the winter. By spring
      the starch is partially changed to dextrin, giving the potatoes a
      sweetness, and when cooked a waxiness. The same change takes place when
      potatoes are frozen. To prevent freezing, keep a pail of cold water
      standing near them.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Potatoes keep best in a cool dry cellar, in barrels or piled in a bin.
      When sprouts appear they should be removed; receiving their nourishment
      from the starch, they deteriorate the potato.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, the starch-grains not having
      reached maturity; therefore they should not be given to children or
      invalids.
    </p>
    <div>
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_310">310</span>
      <h3 class="c018">Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Sweet potatoes, although analogous to white potatoes, are fleshy roots of
      the plant, belong to a different family (Convolvulus), and contain a much
      larger percentage of sugar. Our own country produces large quantities of
      sweet potatoes, which may be grown as far north as New Jersey and Southern
      Michigan. Kiln-dried sweet potatoes are the best, as they do not so
      quickly spoil.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Potatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a vegetable brush, and
      place in dripping-pan. Bake in hot oven forty minutes or until soft,
      remove from oven, and serve at once. If allowed to stand, unless the skin
      is ruptured for escape of steam, they become soggy. Properly baked
      potatoes are more easily digested than potatoes cooked in any other way,
      as some of the starch is changed to dextrin by the intense heat. They are
      better cooked in boiling water than baked in a slow oven.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Boiled Potatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, and drop at once in cold
      water to prevent discoloration; soak one-half hour in the fall, and one to
      two hours in winter and spring. Cook in boiling salted water until soft,
      which is easily determined by piercing with a skewer. For seven potatoes
      allow one tablespoon salt, and boiling water to cover. Drain from water,
      and keep uncovered in warm place until serving time. Avoid sending to
      table in a covered vegetable dish. In boiling large potatoes, it often
      happens that outside is soft, while centre is underdone. To finish cooking
      without potatoes breaking apart, add one pint cold water, which drives
      heat to centre, thus accomplishing the cooking.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Riced Potatoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Force hot boiled potatoes through a potato ricer or coarse strainer. Serve
      lightly piled in a hot vegetable dish.

      <h3 class="c018">Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      To five riced potatoes add three tablespoons butter, one teaspoon salt,
      few grains pepper, and one-third cup hot milk; beat with fork until
      creamy, reheat, and pile lightly in hot dish.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Potato Omelet</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Prepare Mashed Potatoes, turn in hot omelet pan greased with one
      tablespoon butter, spread evenly, cook slowly until browned underneath,
      and fold as an omelet.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Potato Border</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Place a buttered mould on platter, build around it a wall of hot Mashed
      Potatoes, three and one-half inches high by one inch deep, smooth, and

        CHAPTER XXI: SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Salads, which constitute a course in almost every dinner, but a few years
      since seldom appeared on the table. They are now made in an endless
      variety of ways, and are composed of meat, fish, vegetables (alone or in
      combination) or fruits, with the addition of a dressing. The salad plants,
      lettuce, watercress, chiccory, cucumbers, etc., contain but little
      nutriment, but are cooling, refreshing, and assist in stimulating the
      appetite. They are valuable for the water and potash salts they contain.
      The olive oil, which usually forms the largest part of the dressing,
      furnishes nutriment, and is of much value to the system.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Salads made of greens should always be served crisp and cold. The
      vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed to stand in cold or
      ice-water until crisp, then drained and spread on a towel and set aside in
      a cold place until serving time. See Lettuce, page
      <a href="#Page_294" class="pginternal">294</a>. Dressing may be added at
      table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed to stand in
      dressing they will soon wilt. It should be remembered that winter greens
      are raised under glass and should be treated as any other hothouse plant.
      Lettuce will be affected by a change of temperature and wilt just as
      quickly as delicate flowers.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well utilized in salads,
      but are best mixed with French Dressing and allowed to stand in a cold
      place one hour before serving. Where several vegetables are used in the
      same salad they should be marinated separately, and arranged for serving
      just before sending to table.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_323">323</span>Meat for salads should be
      freed from skin and gristle, cut in small cubes, and allowed to stand
      mixed with French Dressing before combining with vegetables. Fish should
      be flaked or cut in cubes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with salt and pepper,
      add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vinegar is added before oil, the greens
      will become wet, and oil will not cling, but settle to bottom of bowl.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>A Chapon.</strong> Remove a small piece from end of French loaf
      and rub over with a clove of garlic, first dipped in salt. Place in bottom
      of salad bowl before arranging salad. A chapon is often used in vegetable
      salads, and gives an agreeable additional flavor.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Marinate.</strong> The word marinate, as used in cookery, means
      to add salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad ingredient or mixture,
      then allow to let stand until well seasoned.

      oil, and vinegar or lemon juice alternately, until all is used, stirring
      or beating constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a
      curdled appearance. A smooth consistency may be restored by taking yolk of

      have bowl containing mixture placed in a larger bowl of crushed ice, to
      which a small quantity of water has been added. Olive oil for making
      Mayonnaise should always be thoroughly chilled. A silver fork, wire whisk,
      small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater may be used as preferred. If one
      has a Keystone Egg-beater, dressing may be made very quickly by its use.
      Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon liquefies

      brown; take from iron and invert on brown paper to drain.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Heat Timbale Iron.</strong> Heat fat until nearly hot enough to
      fry uncooked mixtures. Put iron into hot fat, having fat deep enough to
      more than cover it, and let stand until heated. The only way of knowing
      when iron is of right temperature is to take it from fat, shake what fat
      may drip from it, lower in batter to three-fourths its depth, raise from
      batter, then immerse in hot fat. If batter does not cling to iron, or
      drops from iron as soon as immersed in fat, it is either too hot or not
      sufficiently heated.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Form Timbales.</strong> Turn timbale batter into a cup. Lower
      hot iron into cup, taking care that batter covers iron to only
      three-fourths its depth. When immersed in fat, mixture will rise to top of
      iron, and when crisp and brown may be easily slipped off. If too much
      batter is used, in cooking it will rise over top of iron, and in order to
      remove timbale it must be cut around with a sharp knife close to top of
      iron. If the cases are soft rather than crisp, batter is too thick and
      must be diluted with milk.

      Put vegetables, seasonings, and wine (except two tablespoons) in a
      saucepan; cook eight minutes, and strain, reserving liquid. Add gelatine
      to stock, then add lemon juice. Heat to boiling-point and add strained
      liquid. Season with salt and cayenne. Beat whites of eggs slightly, add
      two tablespoons wine, and dilute with one cup hot mixture. Add slowly to
      remaining mixture, stirring constantly until boiling-point is reached.

    <p class="c019">
      Peel six small firm tomatoes, and remove pulp, having opening in tops as
      small as possible. Sprinkle insides with salt, invert, and let stand
      thirty minutes. Fill with vegetable or chicken salad. Cover tops with
      Mayonnaise to which has been added a small quantity of dissolved gelatine,
      and garnish with capers and sliced pickles. Place a pan in ice-water,
      cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, and let stand
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_383">383</span>until jelly is firm. Arrange
      tomatoes on jelly garnished side down. Add more aspic jelly mixture, let
      stand until firm, and so continue until all is used. Chill thoroughly,
      turn on a serving dish, and garnish around base with parsley.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Stuffed Olives in Aspic</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Stone olives, using an olive stoner, and fill cavities thus made with
      green butter. Place small Dario moulds in pan of ice-water, and pour in
      aspic jelly mixture (see p.
      <a href="#Page_382" class="pginternal">382</a>) one-fourth inch deep. When
      firm put an olive in each mould (keeping olives in place by means of small
      wooden skewers) and add aspic by spoonfuls until moulds are filled. Chill
      thoroughly, remove to circular slices of liver sausage, garnish with green
      butter forced through a pastry bag and tube, yolks of “hard-boiled” eggs
      forced through a strainer, and red peppers cut in fancy shapes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>Green Butter.</strong> Mix yolk one “hard-boiled” egg, two
      tablespoons butter, one sprig parsley, one sprig tarragon, one small
      shallot, one-half teaspoon anchovy paste, one teaspoon capers, and one
      teaspoon chopped gherkins, and pound in a mortar; then rub through a very
      fine sieve. Season with salt and pepper, and add a few drops vinegar.

    <p class="c019">
      Cook a tongue according to directions on page
      <a href="#Page_210" class="pginternal">210</a>. After removing skin and
      roots, run a skewer through tip of tongue and fleshy part, thus keeping
      tongue in shape. When cool, remove skewer. Put a round pan in ice-water,
      cover bottom with brown aspic, and when firm decorate with cooked carrot,
      turnip, beet cut in fancy shapes, and parsley. Cover with aspic jelly
      mixture, adding it by spoonfuls so as not to disarrange vegetables. When
      this layer of mixture is firm, put in tongue, adding gradually remaining
      mixture as in Tomatoes in Aspic.

      bottom with aspic jelly mixture, and when firm garnish with truffles and
      egg custard thinly sliced and cut in fancy shapes. The smaller the shapes
      the more elaborate may be the designs. When garnishing with small shapes,
      pieces are so difficult to handle that they should be taken on the pointed
      end of a larding-needle, and placed as desired on jelly. Add aspic mixture
      by spoonfuls, that designs may not be disturbed. When mixture is added,
      and firm to the depth of three-fourths inch, place in the bird, breast
      down. If sides of mould are to be decorated, dip pieces in jelly and they
      will cling to pan. Add remaining mixture gradually as in Tomatoes in
      Aspic. Small birds, chicken, capon, or turkey, may be put in aspic.

    <h3 class="c018">To Whip Cream</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Thin and heavy cream are both used in making and garnishing desserts.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Heavy cream</em> is bought in half-pint, pint, and quart glass jars,
      and usually retails at sixty cents per quart; <em>thin</em> or
      <em>strawberry cream</em> comes in glass jars or may be bought in bulk,
      and usually retails for thirty cents per quart. Heavy cream is very rich;
      for which reason, when whipped without
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_426">426</span>being diluted, it is employed
      as a garnish; even when so used, it is generally diluted with one-fourth
      to one-third its bulk in milk; when used in combination with other
      ingredients for making desserts, it is diluted from one-half to two-thirds
      its bulk in milk. Thin cream is whipped without being diluted. Cream
      should be thoroughly chilled for whipping. Turn cream to be whipped into a
      bowl (care being taken not to select too large a bowl), and set in pan of
      crushed ice, to which water is added that cream may be quickly chilled;
      without addition of water, cream will not be so thoroughly chilled.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For whipping heavy cream undiluted, or diluted with one-third or less its
      bulk in milk, use Dover egg-beater; undiluted heavy cream if beaten a
      moment too long will come to butter. Heavy cream diluted, whipped,
      sweetened, and flavored, is often served with puddings, and called Cream
      Sauce.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Thin cream is whipped by using a whip churn, as is heavy cream when
      diluted with one-half to two-thirds its bulk in milk. Place churn in bowl
      containing cream, hold down cover with left hand, with right hand work
      dasher with quick downward and slow upward motions; avoid raising dasher
      too high in cylinder, thus escaping spattering of cream. The first whip
      which appears should be stirred into cream, as air bubbles are too large
      and will break; second whip should be removed by spoonfuls to a strainer,
      strainer to be placed in a pan, as some cream will drain through. The
      first cream which drains through may be turned into bowl to be rewhipped,
      and continue whipping as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      There will be some cream left in bowl which does not come above
      perforations in whip churn, and cannot be whipped. Cream which remains may
      be scalded and used to dissolve gelatine when making desserts which
      require gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. By following
      these directions one need have no difficulty, if cream is of right
      consistency; always bearing in mind heavy cream must be whipped with a
      Dover egg-beater; thin cream must be whipped with a churn.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Ices and other frozen dishes comprise the most popular desserts.
      Hygienically speaking, they cannot be recommended for the final course of
      a dinner, as cold mixtures reduce the temperature of the stomach, thus
      retarding digestion until the normal temperature is again reached. But how
      cooling, refreshing, and nourishing, when properly taken, and of what
      inestimable value in the sick room!
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Frozen dishes include:—</p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Water ice</em>,—fruit juice sweetened, diluted with water, and frozen.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Sherbet</em>,—water ice to which is added a small quantity of
      dissolved gelatine or beaten whites of eggs.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Frappé</em>,—water ice frozen to consistency of mush; in freezing,
      equal parts of salt and ice being used to make it granular.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Punch</em>,—water ice to which is added spirit and spice.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Sorbet</em>,—strictly speaking, frozen punch; the name is often given
      to a water ice where several kinds of fruit are used.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Philadelphia Ice Cream</em>,—thin cream, sweetened, flavored, and
      frozen.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Plain Ice Cream</em>,—custard foundation, thin cream, and flavoring.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <em>Mousse</em>,—heavy cream, beaten until stiff, sweetened, flavored,
      placed in a mould, packed in salt and ice (using two parts crushed ice to
      one part salt), and allowed to stand three hours; or whip from thin cream
      may be used folded into mixture containing small quantity of gelatine.

      <h3 class="c018">How to Freeze Desserts</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      The prejudice of thinking a frozen dessert difficult to prepare has long
      since been overcome. With ice cream freezer, burlap bag, wooden mallet or
      axe, small saucepan, sufficient ice and coarse rock salt, the process
      neither takes much time nor patience. Snow may be used instead of ice; if
      not readily acted on by salt, pour in one cup cold water. Crush ice finely
      by placing in bag and giving a few blows with mallet or broad side of axe;
      if there are any coarse pieces, remove them. Place can containing mixture
      to be frozen in wooden tub, cover, and adjust top. Turn crank to make sure
      can fits in socket. Allow three level measures ice to one of salt, and
      repeat until ice and salt come to top of can, packing solidly, using
      handle of mallet to force it down. If only small quantity is to be frozen,
      the ice and salt need come only a little higher in the tub than mixture to
      be frozen. These are found the best proportions of ice and salt to insure
      smooth, fine-grained cream, sherbet, or water ice, while equal parts of
      salt and ice are used for freezing frappé. If a larger proportion of salt
      is used, mixture will freeze in shorter time and be of granular
      consistency, which is desirable only for frappé.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      The mixture increases in bulk during freezing, so the can should never be
      more than three-fourths filled; by overcrowding can, cream will be made
      coarse-grained. Turn the crank slowly and steadily to expose as large
      surface of mixture as possible to ice and salt. After frozen to a mush,
      the crank may be turned more rapidly, adding more ice and salt if needed;
      never draw off salt water until mixture is frozen, unless there is
      possibility of its getting into the can, for salt water is what effects
      freezing; until ice melts, no change will take place. After freezing is
      accomplished, draw off water, remove dasher, and with spoon pack solidly.
      Put cork in opening of cover, then put on cover. Re-pack freezer, using
      four measures ice to one of salt. Place over top newspapers or piece of
      carpet; when serving time comes, remove can, wipe carefully, and place in
      vessel of cool water; let stand one minute, remove cover, and run a knife
      around <span class="pageno" id="Page_435">435</span>edge of cream, invert
      can on serving dish, and frozen mixture will slip out. Should there be any
      difficulty, a cloth wrung out of hot water, passed over can, will aid in
      removing mixture.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">To Line a Mould</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Allow mould to stand in salt and ice until well chilled. Remove cover, put
      in mixture by spoonfuls, and spread with back of spoon or a case knife
      evenly three-quarters inch thick.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">To Mould Frozen Mixtures</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      When frozen mixtures are to be bricked or moulded, avoid freezing too
      hard. Pack mixture solidly in moulds and cover with buttered paper,
      buttered side up. Have moulds so well filled that mixture is forced down
      sides of mould when cover is pressed down. Re-pack in salt and ice, using
      four parts ice to one part salt. If these directions are carefully
      followed, one may feel no fear that salt water will enter cream, even
      though moulds be immersed in salt water.

        CHAPTER XXVII: PASTRY</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Pastry cannot be easily excluded from the menu of the New Englander. Who
      can dream of a Thanksgiving dinner without a pie! The last decade has done
      much to remove pies from the <em>daily</em> bill of fare, and in their
      place are found delicate puddings and seasonable fruits.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      If pastry is to be served, have it of the best,—light, flaky, and tender.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">To pastry belongs, 1st, Puff Paste; 2d, Plain Paste.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      Puff paste, which to many seems so difficult of preparation, is rarely
      attempted by any except professionals. As a matter of fact, one who has
      never handled a rolling-pin is less liable to fail, under the guidance of
      a good teacher, than an old cook, who finds it difficult to overcome the
      bad habit of using too much force in rolling. It is necessary to work
      rapidly and with a light touch. A cold room is of great advantage.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shortenings, thoroughly
      chilled, are essential. Its lightness depends on the amount of air
      enclosed and expansion of that air in baking. The flakiness depends upon
      kind and amount of shortening used. Lard makes more tender crust than
      butter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. Puff paste is usually
      shortened with butter, though some chefs prefer beef suet. Eggs and ice
      were formerly used, but are not essentials.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Butter should be washed if pastry is to be of the best, so as to remove
      salt and buttermilk, thus making it of a waxy consistency, easy to handle.

      ><strong>Rules for Washing Butter.</strong> Scald and chill an earthen
      bowl. Heat palms of hands in hot water, and chill in cold water. By
      following these directions, butter will not adhere to bowl nor hands. Wash
      butter in bowl by squeezing with hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl
      under a cold-water faucet and allowing water to run. A small amount of
      butter may be washed by using a wooden spoon in place of the hands.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For rolling paste, use a smooth wooden board, and wooden rolling-pin with
      handles.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Puff paste should be used for vol-au-vents, patties, rissoles, bouchées,
      cheese straws, tarts, etc. It may be used for rims and upper crusts of
      pies, but never for lower crusts. Plain paste may be used where pastry is
      needed, except for vol-au-vents and patties.

    </div>
    <p class="c009">
      Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies. Reserve two
      tablespoons of butter, and shape remainder into a circular piece one-half
      inch thick, and put on floured board. Work two tablespoons of butter into
      flour with the tips of fingers of the right hand. Moisten to a dough with
      cold water, turn on slightly floured board, and knead one minute. Cover
      with towel, and let stand five minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Pat and roll one-fourth inch thick, keeping paste a little wider than
      long, and corners square. If this cannot be accomplished with rolling-pin,
      draw into shape with fingers. Place butter on centre of lower half of
      paste. Cover butter by folding upper half of paste over it. Press edges
      firmly, to enclose as much air as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, the left side under
      enclosed butter. Turn paste half-way round, cover, and let stand five
      minutes. Pat, and roll one-fourth inch thick, having paste longer than
      wide, lifting often to prevent paste from sticking, and dredging board
      slightly with flour when necessary. Fold from ends towards centre, making
      three layers. Cover, and let stand five minutes. Repeat
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_462">462</span>twice, turning paste half-way
      round each time before rolling. After fourth rolling, fold from ends to
      centre, and double, making four layers. Put in cold place to chill; if
      outside temperature is not sufficiently cold, fold paste in a towel, put
      in a dripping-pan, and place between dripping pans of crushed ice. If
      paste is to be kept for several days, wrap in a napkin, put in tin pail
      and cover tightly, then put in cold place; if in ice box, do not allow
      pail to come in direct contact with ice.

    <h3 class="c018">To Bake Puff Paste</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Baking of puff paste requires as much care and judgment as making. After
      shaping, chill thoroughly before baking. Puff paste requires hot oven,
      greatest heat coming from the bottom, that the paste may properly rise.
      While rising it is often necessary to decrease the heat by lifting covers
      or opening the check to stove. Turn frequently, that it may rise evenly.
      When it has risen its full height, slip a pan under the sheet on which
      paste is baking to prevent burning on the bottom. Puff paste should be
      baked on a tin sheet covered with a double thickness of brown paper, or
      dripping-pan may be used, lined with brown paper. The temperature for
      baking of patties should be about the same as for raised biscuit;
      vol-au-vents require less heat, and are covered for first half-hour to
      prevent scorching on top.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Patty Shells</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Roll puff paste one-quarter inch thick, shape with a patty cutter, first
      dipped in flour; remove centres from one-half the rounds with smaller
      cutter. Brush over with cold water the larger pieces near the edge, and
      fit on rings, pressing lightly. Place in towel between pans of crushed
      ice, and chill until paste is stiff; if cold weather, chill out of doors.
      Place on iron or tin sheet covered with brown paper, and bake twenty-five
      minutes in hot oven. The shells should rise their full height and begin to
      brown in twelve to fifteen minutes; continue browning, and finish baking
      in twenty-five minutes. Pieces cut from centre of rings of patties may be
      baked and used for patty covers, or put together, rolled, and
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_463">463</span>cut for unders. Trimmings
      from puff paste should be carefully laid on top of each other, patted, and
      rolled out.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Vol-au-vents</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Roll puff paste one-third inch thick, mark an oval on paste with cutter or
      mould, and cut out with sharp knife, first dipped in flour. Brush over
      near the edge with cold water, put on a rim three-fourths inch wide, press
      lightly, chill, and bake. Vol-au-vents require for baking forty-five
      minutes to one hour. During the first half-hour they should be covered,
      watched carefully, and frequently turned. The paste cut from centre of rim
      should be rolled one-quarter inch thick, shaped same size as before
      rolling, chilled, baked, and used for cover to the Vol-au-vent.

      large enough to line a pie plate. Pat and roll out, keeping the paste as
      circular in form as possible. With care and experience there need be no
      trimmings. Worked-over pastry is never as satisfactory. The remaining
      one-fourth tablespoon lard is used to dot over upper crust of pie
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_465">465</span>just before sending to oven;
      this gives the pie a flaky appearance. Ice-water has a similar effect. If
      milk is brushed over the pie it has a glazed appearance. This quantity of
      paste will make one pie with two crusts and a few puffs, or two pies with
      one crust where the rim is built up and fluted.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Paste for pies should be one-fourth inch thick and rolled a little larger
      than the plate to allow for shrinking. In dividing paste for pies, allow
      more for upper than under crusts. Always perforate upper crusts that steam
      may escape. Some make a design, others pierce with a large fork.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Flat rims for pies should be cut in strips three-fourths inch wide. Under
      crusts should be brushed with cold water before putting on rims, and rims
      slightly fulled, otherwise they will shrink from edge of plate. The pastry
      jagger, a simple device for cutting paste, makes rims with fluted edges.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Pies requiring two crusts sometimes have a rim between the crusts. This is
      mostly confined to mince pieces, where there is little danger of juice
      escaping. Sometimes a rim is placed over upper crust. Where two pieces of
      paste are put together, the under piece should always be brushed with cold
      water, the upper piece placed over, and the two pressed lightly together;
      otherwise they will separate during baking.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      When juicy fruit is used for filling pies, some of the juices are apt to
      escape during baking. As a precaution, bind with a strip of cotton cloth
      wrung out of cold water and cut one inch wide and long enough to encircle
      the plate. Squash, pumpkin, and custard pies are much less care during
      baking when bound. Where cooked fruits are used for filling, it is
      desirable to bake crusts separately. This is best accomplished by covering
      an inverted deep pie plate with paste and baking for under crust. Prick
      with a fork before baking. Slip from plate, and fill. For
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_467">467</span>upper crusts, roll a piece of
      paste a little larger than the pie plate, prick, and bake on a tin sheet.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For baking pies, perforated tin plates are used. They may be bought
      shallow or deep. By the use of such plates the under crust is well cooked.
      Pastry should be thoroughly baked and well browned. Pies require from
      thirty-five to forty-five minutes for baking. Never grease a pie plate;
      good pastry greases its own tin. Slip pies, when slightly cooled, to
      earthen plates.

    <h4 class="c021">For Pies, Puddings, and Desserts</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Eggs for meringues should be thoroughly chilled, and beaten with silver
      fork, wire spoon, or whisk. Where several eggs are needed, much time is
      saved by using a whisk. Meringues on pies, puddings, or desserts may be
      spread evenly, spread and piled in the centre, put on lightly by
      spoonfuls, or spread evenly with part of the mixture, the remainder being
      forced through a pastry bag and tube.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Meringues I and III should be baked fifteen minutes in slow oven. Meringue
      II should be cooked eight minutes
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_480">480</span>in moderate oven; if removed
      from oven before cooked, the eggs will liquefy and meringue settle; if
      cooked too long, meringue is tough.

      Put whites of eggs and sugar in bowl, beat mixture until stiff enough to

        CHAPTER XXXI: CAKE</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      The mixing and baking of cake requires more care and judgment than any
      other branch of cookery; notwithstanding, it seems the one most frequently
      attempted by the inexperienced.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">Two kinds of cake mixtures are considered:—</p>
    <p class="c009">I. Without butter. Example: Sponge Cakes.</p>
    <p class="c009">II. With butter. Examples: Cup and Pound Cakes.</p>
    <p class="c009">
      In cake making (1) the best ingredients are essential; (2) great care must
      be taken in measuring and combining ingredients; (3) pans must be properly
      prepared; (4) oven heat must be regulated, and cake watched during baking.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Best tub butter, fine granulated sugar, fresh eggs, and pastry flour are
      essentials for good cake. Coarse granulated sugar, bought by so many, if
      used in cake making, gives a coarse texture and hard crust. Pastry flour
      contains more starch and less gluten than bread flour, therefore makes a
      lighter, more tender cake. If bread flour must be used, allow two
      tablespoons less for each cup than the recipe calls for. Flour differs
      greatly in thickening properties; for this reason it is always well when
      using from a new bag to try a small cake, as the amount of flour given may
      not make the perfect loaf. In winter, cake may be made of less flour than
      in summer.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Before attempting to mix cake, study How to Measure (p.
      <a href="#Page_25" class="pginternal">25</a>) and How to Combine
      Ingredients (p. <a href="#Page_26" class="pginternal">26</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Look at the fire, and replenish by sprinkling on a small quantity of coal
      if there is not sufficient heat to effect the baking.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_498">498</span
      ><strong>To Mix Sponge Cake.</strong> Separate yolks from whites of eggs.
      Beat yolks until thick and lemon-colored, using an egg-beater; add sugar
      gradually, and continue beating; then add flavoring. Beat whites until
      stiff and dry,—when they will fly from the beater,—and add to the first
      mixture. Mix and sift flour with salt, and cut and fold in at the last. If
      mixture is beaten after the addition of flour, much of the work already
      done of enclosing a large amount of air will be undone by breaking air
      bubbles. These rules apply to a mixture where baking powder is not
      employed.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Mix Butter Cakes.</strong> An earthen bowl should always be
      used for mixing cake, and a wooden cake-spoon with slits lightens the
      labor. Measure dry ingredients, and mix and sift baking powder and spices,
      if used, with flour. Count out number of eggs required, breaking each
      separately that there may be no loss should a stale egg chance to be found
      in the number, separating yolks from whites if rule so specifies. Measure
      butter, then liquid. Having everything in readiness, the mixing may be
      quickly accomplished. If butter is very hard, by allowing it to stand a
      short time in a warm room it is measured and creamed much easier. If time
      cannot be allowed for this to be done, warm bowl by pouring in some hot
      water, letting stand one minute, then emptying and wiping dry. Avoid
      overheating bowl, as butter will become oily rather than creamy. Put
      butter in bowl, and cream by working with a wooden spoon until soft and of
      a creamy consistency; then add sugar gradually, and continue beating. Add
      yolks of eggs or whole eggs beaten until light, liquid, and flour mixed
      and sifted with baking powder; or liquid and flour may be added
      alternately. When yolks and whites of eggs are beaten separately, whites
      are usually added at the last, as is the case when whites of eggs alone
      are used. A cake can be made fine-grained only by long beating, although
      light and delicate with a small amount of beating. Never stir cake after
      the final beating, remembering that beating motion should always be the
      last used. Fruit, when added to cake, is usually floured to prevent its
      settling to the bottom. This is not necessary if it is added directly
      after the sugar, which is desirable in all dark
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_499">499</span>cakes. If a light fruit cake
      is made, fruit added in this way discolors the loaf. Citron is first cut
      in thin slices, then in strips, floured, and put in between layers of cake
      mixtures. Raisins are seeded and cut, rather than chopped.
      <em>To seed raisins</em>, wet tips of fingers in a cup of warm water. Then
      break skins with fingers or cut with a vegetable knife; remove seeds, and
      put in cup of water. This is better than covering raisins with warm water;
      if this be done, water clings to fruit, and when dredged with flour a
      pasty mass is formed on the outside. Washed currants, put up in packages,
      are quite free from stems and foreign substances, and need only picking
      over and rolling in flour. Currants bought in bulk need thorough cleaning.
      First roll in flour, which helps to start dirt; wash in cold water, drain,
      and spread to dry; then roll again in flour before using.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Butter and Fill Pans.</strong> Grease pans with melted fat,
      applying the same with a butter brush. If butter is used, put in a small
      saucepan and place on back of range; when melted, salt will settle to the
      bottom; butter is then called <em>clarified</em>. Just before putting in
      mixture, dredge pans thoroughly with flour, invert, and shake pan to
      remove all superfluous flour, leaving only a thin coating which adheres to
      butter. This gives to cake a smooth under surface, which is especially
      desirable if cake is to be frosted. Pans may be lined with paper. If this
      is done, paper should just cover bottom of pan and project over sides.
      Then ends of pan and paper are buttered.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      In filling pans, have the mixture come well to the corners and sides of
      pans, leaving a slight depression in the centre, and when baked the cake
      will be perfectly flat on top. Cake pans should be filled nearly
      two-thirds full if cake is expected to rise to top of pan.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Bake Cake.</strong> The baking of cake is more critical than
      the mixing. Many a well-mixed cake has been spoiled in the baking. No oven
      thermometer has yet proved practical, and although many teachers of
      cookery have given oven tests, experience alone has proved the most
      reliable teacher. In baking cake, divide the time required into quarters.
      During the first quarter the mixture should begin to rise; second
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_500">500</span>quarter, continue rising and
      begin to brown; third quarter, continue browning; fourth quarter, finish
      baking and shrink from pan. If oven is too hot, open check and raise back
      covers, or leave oven door ajar. It is sometimes necessary to cover cake
      with brown paper; there is, however, danger of cake adhering to paper.
      Cake should be often looked at during baking, and providing oven door is
      opened and closed carefully, there is no danger of this causing cake to
      fall. Cake should not be moved in oven until it has risen its full height;
      after this it is usually desirable to move it that it may be evenly
      browned. Cake when done shrinks from the pan, and in most cases this is a
      sufficient test; however, in pound cakes this rule does not apply. Pound
      and rich fruit cakes are tested by pressing surface with tip of finger. If
      cake feels firm to touch and follows finger back into place, it is safe to
      remove it from the oven. When baking cake arrange to have nothing else in
      the oven, and place loaf or loaves as near the centre of oven as possible.
      If placed close to fire-box, one side of loaf is apt to become burned
      before sufficiently risen to turn. If cake is put in too slow an oven, it
      often rises over sides of pan and is of very coarse texture; if put in too
      hot an oven, it browns on top before sufficiently risen, and in its
      attempt to rise breaks through the crust, thus making an unsightly loaf.
      Cake will also crack on top if too much flour has been used. The oven
      should be kept at as nearly uniform temperature as possible. Small and
      layer cakes require a hotter oven than loaf cakes.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Remove Cake From Pans.</strong> Remove cake from pans as soon
      as it comes from the oven, by inverting pan on a wire cake cooler, or on a
      board covered with a piece of old linen. If cake is inclined to stick, do
      not hurry it from pan, but loosen with knife around edges, and rest pan on
      its four sides successively; thus by its own weight cake may be helped
      out.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Frost Cake.</strong> Where cooked frostings are used, it makes
      but little difference whether they are spread on hot or cold cake. Where
      uncooked frostings are used, it is best to have the cake slightly warm,
      with the exception of Confectioners’ Frosting, where boiling water is
      employed.

      Genuine sponge cake contains no rising properties, but is made light by
      the quantity of air beaten into both yolks and whites of eggs, and the
      expansion of that air in baking. It requires a slow oven. All so-called
      sponge cakes which have the addition of soda and cream of tartar or baking
      powder require same oven temperature as butter cakes. When failures are
      made in Sunshine and Angel Cake, they are usually traced to baking in too
      slow an oven, and removing from oven before thoroughly cooked.

        CHAPTER XXXIII: FANCY CAKES AND CONFECTIONS</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Almond paste for making macaroons and small fancy cakes may be bought of
      dealers who keep confectioners’ supplies, although sometimes a resident
      baker or confectioner will sell a small quantity. Almond paste is put up
      in five-pound tin pails, and retails for one and one-half dollars per
      pail. During the cold weather it will keep after being opened for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Macaroons</h3>
    <div class="lg-container-b c020">

    </div>
    <p class="c009">
      Work together almond paste and sugar on a smooth board or marble slab.
      Then add whites of eggs gradually, and work until mixture is perfectly
      smooth. Confectioners at first use the hand, afterwards a palette knife,
      which is not only of use for mixing but for keeping board clean. Shape,
      using a pastry bag and tube, on a tin sheet covered with buttered paper,
      one-half inch apart; or drop mixture from tip of spoon in small piles.
      Macaroon mixture is stiff enough to hold its shape, but in baking spreads.
      Bake fifteen to twenty minutes in a slow oven. If liked soft, they should
      be slightly baked. After removing from oven, invert paper, and wet with a
      cloth wrung out of cold water, when macaroons will easily slip off.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Almond Macaroons</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Sprinkle Macaroons, before baking, with almonds blanched and shredded, or
      chopped.

      Mix same as Macaroons. Shape mixture, which is quite soft, in a long roll.
      Cut pieces from roll three-fourths inch long. Roll each separately in
      chopped nuts, at the same time shaping to form a crescent. Bake twenty
      minutes on a buttered tin sheet in a slow oven. Cool, and frost with
      Confectioners’ Frosting, made thin enough to apply with a brush, and
      flavored with lemon juice until quite acid. Other nuts may be used in
      place of almonds.

      Mix same as Macaroons. Dredge a board with sugar, knead mixture slightly,
      and shape in a long roll. Pat, and roll one-fourth inch thick, using a
      rolling-pin. After rolling the piece should be four inches wide. Spread
      with frosting made of white of one egg and two-thirds cup confectioners’
      sugar beaten together until stiff enough to spread. Cut in strips four
      inches long by three-fourths inch wide. This must be quickly done, as a
      crust soon forms over frosting. To accomplish this, use two knives, one
      placed through mixture where dividing line is to be made, and the other
      used to make a clean sharp cut on both sides of first knife. Knives should
      be kept clean by wiping on a damp cloth. Remove strips as soon as cut, to
      a tin sheet, greased with lard and then floured. Bake twenty minutes on
      centre grate in a slow oven.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Horseshoes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Use Cinnamon Bar mixture. Cover with frosting colored with fruit red. Cut
      in strips six inches long by one-half inch wide. As soon as cut, shape
      quickly, at the same time carefully, in form of horseshoes. Bake same as
      Cinnamon Bars. When cool, make eight dots with chocolate frosting to
      represent nails.

    <h3 class="c018">Stuffed Dates I</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Make a cut the entire length of dates and remove stones. Fill cavities
      with castanea nuts, English walnuts, or blanched almonds, and shape in
      original form. Roll in granulated sugar. Pile in rows on a small plate
      covered with a doily. If castanea nuts are used, with a sharp knife cut
      off the brown skin which lies next to shell.

    <h3 class="c018">Stuffed Dates II</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove stones from dates and fill cavities with Neufchâtel cheese.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Salted Almonds I</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Blanch one-fourth pound Jordan almonds and dry on a towel. Put one-third
      cup olive oil in a very small saucepan. When hot, put in one-fourth of the
      almonds and fry until delicately browned, stirring to keep almonds
      constantly in motion. Remove with a spoon or small skimmer, taking up as
      little oil as possible. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt;
      repeat until all are fried. It may be
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_536">536</span>necessary to remove some of
      the salt by wiping nuts with a napkin.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Salted Almonds II</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Prepare almonds as for Salted Almonds I. Fry in one-third cup fat, using
      half lard and half clarified butter or all cocoanut butter. Drain, and
      sprinkle with salt.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Salted Peanuts</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      In buying peanuts for salting, get those which have not been roasted.
      Remove skins and fry same as Salted Almonds I or II.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Salted Pecans</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Shelled pecans may be bought by the pound, which is much the best way when
      used for salting, as it is difficult to remove the nut meat without
      breaking. Fry same as salted Almonds I or II. Care must be taken that they
      do not remain in fat too long; having a dark skin, color does not
      determine when they are sufficiently cooked.

      Pick over and remove stems from figs and stones from dates. Mix fruit with
      walnut meat, and force through a meat chopper. Work, using the hands, on a
      board dredged with confectioners’ sugar, until well blended. Roll to
      one-fourth inch thickness, using confectioners’ sugar for dredging board
      and pin. Shape with a small round cutter, first dipped in sugar, or cut
      with a sharp knife in three-fourth inch squares. Roll each piece in
      confectioners’ sugar, and shake to remove superfluous sugar. Pack in
      layers in a tin box, putting paper between each layer. These confections
      may be used at dinner in place of bonbons or ginger chips. A combination
      of nut meat (walnut, almond, and filbert) may be used in equal
      proportions.

      Put butter in kettle, place over fire, and when melted, add molasses and
      sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. During the first of the boiling
      stirring is unnecessary, but when nearly cooked, it should be constantly
      stirred. Boil until, when tried in cold water, mixture will become
      brittle. Add vinegar just before taking from fire. Pour into a well
      buttered pan. When cool enough to handle, pull until porous and
      light-colored, allowing candy to come in contact with tips of fingers and
      thumbs, not to be squeezed in the hand. Cut in small pieces, using large
      shears or a sharp knife, and then arrange on slightly buttered plates to

      candy, bring edges of candy together, and press firmly over fondant. With
      both hands pull candy into a long strip. Cut in small pieces; each piece

      Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of sugar and water boiled
      together (with a small quantity of cream of tartar to prevent sugar from
      granulating) to soft ball, 238° F. The professional confectioner is able
      to decide when syrup has boiled to the right temperature by sound while
      boiling, and by testing in cold water; these tests at first seem somewhat
      difficult to the amateur, but only a little experience is necessary to
      make fondant successfully. A sugar thermometer is often employed, and
      proves valuable, as by its use one need not exercise his judgment.

      Put ingredients into a smooth granite stewpan. Stir, place on range, and
      heat gradually to boiling-point. Boil without stirring until, when tried
      in cold water, a soft ball may be formed that will just keep in shape,
      which is 238° F. After a few minutes’ boiling, sugar will adhere to sides
      of kettle; this should be washed off with the hand first dipped in cold
      water. Have a pan of cold water near at
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_545">545</span>hand, dip hand in cold water,
      then quickly wash off a small part of the sugar with tips of fingers, and
      repeat until all sugar adhering to side of saucepan is removed. If this is
      quickly done, there is no danger of burning the fingers. Pour slowly on a
      slightly oiled marble slab. Let stand a few minutes to cool, but not long
      enough to become hard around the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping knife
      to one end of marble, and work with a wooden spatula until white and
      creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency, and begin to lump,
      when it should be kneaded with the hands until perfectly smooth.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper to exclude air, that a crust may
      not form on top, and let stand twenty-four hours. A large oiled platter
      and wooden spoon may be used in place of marble slab and spatula. Always
      make fondant on a clear day, as a damp, heavy atmosphere has an
      unfavorable effect on the boiling of sugar.

    <h4 class="c021">Bonbons</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      The centres of bonbons are made of fondant shaped in small balls. If White
      Fondant is used, flavor as desired,—vanilla being usually preferred. For
      cocoanut centres, work as much shredded cocoanut as possible into a small
      quantity of fondant; for nut centres, surround pieces of nut meat with
      fondant, using just enough to cover. French candied cherries
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_546">546</span>are often used in this way.
      Allow balls to stand over night, and dip the following day.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Dip Bonbons.</strong> Put fondant in saucepan, and melt over
      hot water; color and flavor as desired. In coloring fondant, dip a small
      wooden skewer in coloring paste, take up a small quantity, and dip skewer
      in fondant. If care is not taken, the color is apt to be too intense.
      During dipping, keep fondant over hot water that it may be kept of right
      consistency. For dipping, use a two-tined fork or confectioners’ bonbon
      dipper. Drop centres in fondant one at a time, stir until covered, remove
      from fondant, put on oiled paper, and bring end of dipper over the top of
      bonbon, thus leaving a tail-piece which shows that bonbons have been hand
      dipped. Stir fondant between dippings to prevent a crust from forming.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Cream Mints</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Melt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops of oil of peppermint,
      wintergreen, clove, cinnamon, or orange, and color if desired. Drop from
      tip of spoon on oiled paper. Confectioners use rubber moulds for shaping
      cream mints; but these are expensive for home use, unless one is to make
      mints in large quantities.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Cream Nut Bars</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Melt fondant and flavor, stir in any kind of nut meat, cut in pieces. Turn
      in an oiled pan, cool, and cut in bars with a sharp knife. Maple Fondant
      is delicious with nuts.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Dipped Walnuts</h4>
    <p class="c019">

      Put ingredients in a smooth saucepan. Boil without stirring until syrup
      begins to discolor, which is 300° F. Wash off sugar which adheres to sides
      of saucepan, as in making fondant. Remove saucepan from fire, and place in
      a larger pan of cold water to instantly stop boiling. Remove from cold
      water, and place in saucepan of hot water. Place two broomstick-handles
      over backs of chairs, and spread paper on the floor under them. When syrup
      is slightly cooled, put dipper in syrup, remove from syrup, and shake
      quickly back and forth over broom-handles. Carefully take off spun sugar
      as soon as formed, and shape in nests, or pile lightly on a cold dish.
      Syrup may be colored if desired. Spun Sugar is served around bricks or
      moulds of frozen creams and ices.

    <p class="c009">
      Dippers for spinning sugar are made of coarse wires; about twenty wires,
      ten inches long, are put in a bundle, and fastened with wire coiled round
      and round to form a handle.

        CHAPTER XXXIV: SANDWICHES AND CANAPÉS</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      In preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as thinly as possible, and
      remove crusts. If butter is used, cream the butter, and spread bread
      before cutting from loaf. Spread half the slices with mixture to be used
      for filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cut in squares, oblongs, or
      triangles. If sandwiches are shaped with round or fancy cutters, bread
      should be shaped before spreading, that there may be no waste of butter.
      Sandwiches which are prepared several hours before serving time may be
      kept fresh and moist by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as possible out
      of hot water, and keeping in a cool place. Paraffine paper is often used
      for the same purpose. Bread for sandwiches cuts better when a day old.
      Serve sandwiches piled on a plate covered with a doily.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Rolled Bread</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cut fresh bread, while still warm, in as thin slices as possible, using a
      very sharp knife. Spread evenly with butter which has been creamed. Roll
      slices separately, and tie each with baby ribbon.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Bread and Butter Folds</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove end slice from bread. Spread end of loaf sparingly and evenly with
      butter which has been creamed. Cut off as thin a slice as possible. Repeat
      until the number of slices required are prepared. Remove crusts, put
      together in pairs, and cut in squares, oblongs, or triangles. Use white,
      entire wheat, Graham, or brown bread. Three layer sandwiches are
      attractive when made of entire wheat bread between white slices.
    </p>

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      The chafing-dish, which, within the last few years, has gained so much
      favor, is by no means a utensil of modern invention, as its history may be
      traced to the time of Louis XIV. It finds its place on the breakfast
      table, when the eggs may be cooked to suit the most fastidious; on the
      luncheon table, when a dainty hot dish may be prepared to serve in place
      of the so-oft-seen cold meat; but it is made of greatest use for the
      cooking of late suppers, and always seems to accompany hospitality and
      good cheer.

      It is appreciated and enjoyed by the housekeeper who does her own work, or
      has but one maid, as well as by the society girl who, by its use, first
      gains a taste for the art of cooking. The simple tin chafing-dishes may be
      bought for as small a sum as ninety cents, while the elaborate silver ones
      command as high a price as one hundred dollars. Very attractive dishes are
      made of granite ware, nickel, or copper. The latest patterns have the lamp
      with a screw adjustment to regulate the flame, and a metal tray on which
      to set dish, that it may be moved if necessary while hot, without danger
      of burnt fingers, and that it may not injure the polished table.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      A chafing-dish has two pans, the under one for holding hot water, the
      upper one with long handle for holding food to be cooked. A blazer differs
      from a chafing-dish, inasmuch as it has no hot-water pan.

    <p class="c009">
      Wood alcohol, which is much lower in price than high-proof spirits, is
      generally used in chafing-dishes.

    <p class="c009">
      The Davy Toaster may be used over the chafing-dish for toasting bread and
      broiling.

      </h2>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c014">
      Fruits are usually at their best when served ripe and in season; however,
      a few cannot be taken in their raw state, and still others are rendered
      more easy of digestion by cooking. The methods employed are stewing and
      baking. Fruit should be cooked in earthen or granite ware utensils, and
      silver or wooden spoons should be employed for stirring. It must be
      remembered that all fruits contain one or more acids, and when exposed to
      air and brought in contact with an iron or tin surface, a poisonous
      compound may be formed.

      thoroughly, hull, and turn into dish. Serve with powdered sugar and cream.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      2. Pick over selected strawberries, place in colander, pour over cold
      water, and drain thoroughly. Press powdered sugar into cordial glasses.
      Remove from glasses on centres of fruit plates. Arrange twelve berries
      around each mound of sugar. Berries served in this way should not be
      hulled.

    <h3 class="c018">How to Prepare Cantaloupes and Muskmelons for Serving</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cantaloupes and muskmelons should be very ripe and thoroughly chilled in
      ice box before being prepared for serving. Wipe melons,—if small, cut in
      halves lengthwise; if larger, cut in sections, and remove seeds and
      stringy portion. If one-half is served as a portion, put in cavity one
      tablespoon crushed ice. Serve with salt or powdered sugar.

    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Put bunches in colander and pour over cold water, drain, chill, and
      arrange on serving dish. Imperfect grapes, as well as those under-ripe or
      over-ripe, should be removed. Garnish with grape leaves, if at hand.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Ways of Preparing Oranges for Serving</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      1. Wipe orange and cut in halves crosswise. Place one-half on a fruit
      plate, having an orange spoon or teaspoon on plate at right of fruit.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      2. Peel an orange and remove as much of the white portion as possible.
      Remove pulp by sections, which may be accomplished by using a sharp knife
      and cutting pulp from tough portion first on one side of section, then on
      the other. Should there be any white portion of skin remaining on pulp it
      should be cut off. Arrange sections on glass dish or fruit plate. If the
      orange is a seeded one, remove seeds.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      3. Remove peel from an orange in such a way that there remains a one-half
      inch band of peel equal distance from stem and blossom end. Cut band,
      separate sections, and arrange around a mould of sugar.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">How to Prepare Grape Fruit for Serving</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe grape fruit and cut in halves crosswise. With a small, sharp-pointed
      knife make a cut separating pulp from skin around entire circumference;
      then make cuts separating pulp from tough portion which divides fruit into
      sections. Remove tough portion in one piece, which may be accomplished by
      one cutting with scissors at stem or blossom end close to skin. Sprinkle
      fruit pulp left in grape fruit skin generously with sugar. Let stand ten
      minutes, and serve very cold. Place on fruit plate and garnish with a
      candied cherry.

    <p class="c019">
      Remove pulp from grape fruit, and mix with shredded pineapple, bananas cut
      in slices and slices cut in quarters, and strawberries cut in halves,
      using half as much pineapple and banana as grape fruit, and allowing four
      strawberries to each serve. There should be two cups fruit. Pour over a
      dressing made of one-third cup Sherry wine, three tablespoons apricot
      brandy, one-half cup sugar, and a few grains salt. Chill thoroughly, serve
      in double cocktail glasses, and garnish with candied cherries and leaves.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Apples</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe and core sour apples. Put in a baking-dish, and fill cavities with
      sugar and spice. Allow one-half cup sugar and one-fourth teaspoon cinnamon
      or nutmeg to eight apples. If nutmeg is used, a few drops lemon juice and
      few gratings from rind of lemon to each apple is an improvement. Cover
      bottom of dish with boiling water, and bake in a hot oven until soft,
      basting often with syrup in dish. Serve hot or cold with cream. Many
      prefer to pare apples before baking. When this is done, core before
      paring, that fruit may keep in shape. In the fall, when apples are at
      their best, do not add spices to apples, as their flavor cannot be
      improved; but towards spring they become somewhat tasteless, and spice is
      an improvement.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Sweet Apples</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe and core eight sweet apples. Put in a baking-dish, and fill cavities
      with sugar, allowing one-third cup, or sweeten with molasses. Add
      two-thirds cup boiling water.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_570">570</span>Cover, and bake three hours
      in a slow oven, adding more water if necessary.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Apple Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour apples. Make a syrup by boiling
      seven minutes one cup sugar and one cup water with thin shaving from rind
      of a lemon. Remove lemon, add enough apples to cover bottom of saucepan,
      watch carefully during cooking, and remove as soon as soft. Continue until
      all are cooked. Strain remaining syrup over apples.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Spiced Apple Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour apples. Put in a saucepan,

      apples from burning. Cook to a mush, stirring occasionally.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Apple Ginger</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, pare, and chop sour apples; there should be two and
      one-half pounds. Put in a stewpan and add one and one-half pounds light
      brown sugar, juice and rind of one and one-half lemons, one-half ounce
      ginger root, a few grains salt, and enough water to prevent apples from
      burning. Cover, and cook slowly four hours, adding water as necessary.
      Apple Ginger may be kept for several weeks.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Apple Porcupine</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Make a syrup by boiling eight minutes one and one-half cups sugar and one
      and one-half cups water. Wipe, core, and pare eight apples. Put apples in
      syrup as soon as pared, that they may not discolor. Cook until soft,
      occasionally skimming syrup during cooking. Apples cook better covered
      with the syrup; therefore it is better to use a deep saucepan and have two
      cookings. Drain apples from syrup, cool, fill cavities with jelly,
      marmalade, or preserved fruit, and stick apples with almonds blanched and
      split in halves lengthwise. Serve with Cream Sauce I.

      shallow granite pan or on an old platter. Mix two tablespoons melted
      butter, one-third cup sugar, and two tablespoons lemon juice. Baste
      bananas with one-half the mixture. Bake twenty minutes in a slow oven,
      basting during baking with remaining mixture.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Bananas II</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Arrange bananas in a shallow pan, cover, and bake until skins become very

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Sautéd Bananas</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove skins from bananas, cut in halves lengthwise, and again cut in
      halves crosswise. Dredge with flour, and sauté in clarified butter. Drain,
      and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Peaches</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Peel, cut in halves, and remove stones from six peaches. Place in a
      shallow granite pan. Fill each cavity with one teaspoon sugar, one-half
      teaspoon butter, few drops lemon juice, and a slight grating nutmeg. Cook
      twenty minutes, and serve on circular pieces of buttered dry toast.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Pears</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, and core pears. Put in a deep pudding-dish, sprinkle with
      sugar or add a small quantity of molasses, then add water to prevent pears
      from burning. Cover, and cook two or three hours in a very slow oven.
      Small pears may be baked whole. Seckel pears are delicious when baked.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Baked Quinces</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight quinces. Put in a baking dish,
      sprinkle with three-fourths cup sugar, add one and one-half cups water,
      cover, and cook until soft in a slow oven. Quinces require a long time for
      cooking.

    <p class="c019">
      Pick over and wash three cups cranberries. Put in a stewpan, add one and
      one-fourth cups sugar and one cup boiling water. Cover, and boil ten
      minutes. Care must be taken that they do not boil over. Skim and cool.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Cranberry Jelly</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Pick over and wash four cups cranberries. Put in a stewpan with one cup

      sugar, and cook five minutes. Turn into a mould or glasses.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Stewed Prunes</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash and pick over prunes. Put in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and
      soak two hours; then cook until soft in same water. When nearly cooked,
      add sugar or molasses to sweeten. Many prefer the addition of a small
      quantity of lemon juice.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">Rhubarb Sauce</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Peel and cut rhubarb in one-inch pieces. Put in a saucepan, sprinkle
      generously with sugar, and add enough water to prevent rhubarb from
      burning. Rhubarb contains such a large percentage of water that but little
      additional water is needed. Cook until soft. If rhubarb is covered with
      boiling water, allowed to stand five minutes, then drained and cooked,
      less sugar will be required. Rhubarb is sometimes baked in an earthen
      pudding-dish. If baked slowly for a long time it has a rich red color.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">JELLIES</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Jellies are made of cooked fruit juice and sugar, in nearly all cases the

      to the use of too ripe fruit.

      <strong>To Cover Jelly Glasses.</strong> Cut letter paper in circular
      pieces just to fit in top of glasses. Dip in brandy, and cover jelly. Put
      on tin covers or circular pieces of paper cut larger than the glasses, and
      fastened securely over the edge with mucilage. Some prefer to cover jelly
      with melted paraffine then to adjust covers.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <strong>To Make a Jelly Bag.</strong> Fold two opposite corners of a piece
      of cotton and wool flannel three-fourths yard long. Sew up in the form of
      a cornucopia, rounding at the end. Fell the seam to make more secure. Bind
      the top with tape, and furnish with two or three heavy loops by which it
      may be hung.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Apple Jelly</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and cut in quarters. Put in a
      granite or porcelain-lined preserving kettle, and add cold water to come
      nearly to top of apples. Cover, and cook slowly until apples are soft;
      mash, and drain through a coarse sieve. Avoid squeezing apples, which
      makes jelly cloudy. Then allow juice to drip through a double thickness of
      cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Boil twenty minutes, and add an equal
      quantity of heated sugar; boil five minutes, skim, and turn in glasses.
      Put in a sunny window, and let stand twenty-four hours. Cover, and keep in
      a cool, dry place. Porter apples make a delicious flavored jelly. If
      apples are pared, a much lighter jelly may be made. Gravenstein apples
      make a very spicy jelly.
    </p>

      <strong>To Heat Sugar.</strong> Put in a granite dish, place in oven,
      leaving oven door ajar, and stir occasionally.

      Currants are in the best condition for making jelly between June

      rain. Cherry currants make the best jelly. Equal proportions of red and
      white currants are considered desirable, and make a lighter colored jelly.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Pick over currants, but do not remove stems; wash and drain. Mash a few in
      the bottom of a preserving kettle, using a wooden potato masher; so
      continue until berries are used. Cook slowly until currants look white.
      Strain through a course strainer, then allow juice to drop through a
      double thickness of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Measure, bring to
      boiling-point, and boil five minutes; add unequal measure of heated sugar,

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018">CANNING AND PRESERVING</h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Preserving fruit is cooking it with from three-fourths to its whole weight
      of sugar. By so doing, much of the natural flavor of the fruit is
      destroyed; therefore canning is usually preferred to preserving.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Canning fruit is preserving sterilized fruit in sterilized air-tight jars,
      the sugar being added to give sweetness. Fruits may be canned without
      sugar if perfectly sterilized, that is, freed from all germ life.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Directions for Canning</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good quality, and not
      over-ripe; if over-ripe, some of the spores may survive the boiling, then
      fermentation will take place in a short time.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For canning fruit, allow one-third its weight in sugar, and two and
      one-half to three cups water to each pound of sugar. Boil sugar and water
      ten minutes to make a thin
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_578">578</span>syrup; then cook a small
      quantity of the fruit at a time in the syrup; by so doing, fruit may be
      kept in perfect shape. Hard fruits, like pineapple and quince, are cooked
      in boiling water until nearly soft, then put in syrup to finish cooking.
      Sterilized jars are then filled with fruit, and enough syrup added to
      overflow jars. If there is not sufficient syrup, add boiling water, as
      jars must be filled to overflow. Introduce a spoon between fruit and jar,
      that air bubbles may rise to the top and break; then quickly put on
      rubbers and screw on sterilized covers. Let stand until cold, again screw
      covers, being sure this time that jars are air-tight. While filling jars,
      place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">To Sterilize Jars</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wash jars and fill with cold water. Set in a kettle on a trivet, and
      surround with cold water. Heat gradually to boiling-point, remove from
      water, empty, and fill while hot. Put covers in hot water and let stand
      five minutes. Dip rubber bands in hot water, but do not allow them to
      stand. New rubbers should be used each season, and care must be taken that
      rims of covers are not bent, as jars cannot then be hermetically sealed.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Porter Apples</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, and pare Porter apples, then weigh. Make a syrup by
      boiling for ten minutes one-third their weight in sugar with water,
      allowing two and one-half cups to each pound of sugar. Cook apples in
      syrup until soft, doing a few at a time. Fill jars, following Directions
      for Canning.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Peaches</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing them to stand just long
      enough to easily loosen skins. Remove skins and cook fruit at once, that
      it may not discolor, following Directions for Canning. Some prefer to pare
      peaches, sprinkle with sugar, and let stand over night. In morning drain,
      add water to fruit syrup, bring to boiling-point, and then cook fruit.
      Peaches may be cut in halves, or smaller pieces if desired.

      <h4 class="c021">Canned Pears</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe and pare fruit. Cook whole with stems left on, or remove stems, cut
      in quarters, and core. Follow Directions for Canning. A small piece of
      ginger root or a few slicings of lemon rind may be cooked with syrup.
      Bartlett pears are the best for canning.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Pineapples</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Remove skin and eyes from pineapples; then cut in half-inch slices, and
      slices in cubes, at the same time discarding the core. Follow Directions
      for Canning. Pineapples may be shredded and cooked in one-half their
      weight of sugar without water, and then put in jars. When put up in this
      way they are useful for the making of sherbets and fancy desserts.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Quinces</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe, quarter, core, and pare quinces. Follow Directions for Canning.
      Quinces may be cooked with an equal weight of sweet apples wiped,
      quartered, cored, and pared; in this case use no extra sugar for apples.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Cherries</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Use large white or red cherries. Wash, remove stems, then follow
      Directions for Canning.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Huckleberries</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Pick over and wash berries, then put in a preserving kettle with a small
      quantity of water to prevent berries from burning. Cook until soft,
      stirring occasionally, and put in jars. No sugar is required, but a
      sprinkling of salt is an agreeable addition.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Canned Rhubarb</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Pare rhubarb and cut in one-inch pieces. Pack in a jar, put under cold

      easily removed. Cut in pieces and cook until thoroughly scalded; skim
      often during cooking. Fill jars, following directions given.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Damson Preserves</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Wipe damsons with a piece of cheese-cloth wrung out of cold water, and
      prick each fruit five or six times, using a large needle; then weigh. Make
      a syrup by boiling three-fourths their weight in sugar with water,
      allowing one cup to each pound of sugar. As soon as syrup reaches
      boiling-point, skim, and add plums, a few at a time, that fruit may better
      keep in shape during cooking. Cook until soft. It is well to use two
      kettles, that work may be more quickly done, and syrup need not cook too
      long a time. Put into glass or stone jars.
    </p>
    <h4 class="c021">Strawberry Preserves</h4>
    <p class="c019">
      Pick over, wash, drain, and hull strawberries; then weigh. Fill glass jars
      with berries. Make a syrup same as for Damson Preserve, cooking the syrup
      fifteen minutes. Add syrup to overflow jars; let stand fifteen minutes,
      when fruit will have shrunk, and more fruit must be added to fill jars.
      Screw on covers, put on a trivet in a kettle of cold water, heat water to
      boiling-point, and keep just below boiling-point one hour.

      nearly fill pot with Cold water, add one tablespoon borax, and heat
      gradually until water reaches the boiling-point.
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_590">590</span>Rinse with hot water, wipe,
      and keep on back of range until perfectly dry.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      Never put cogs of a <strong>Dover Egg-beater</strong> in water.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      Never wash <strong>Bread Boards</strong> in a sink. Scrub with grain of
      wood, using a small brush.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      Before using a new <strong>Iron Kettle</strong>, grease inside and
      outside, and let stand forty-eight hours; then wash in hot water in which
      a large lump of cooking soda has been dissolved.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      To clean a <strong>Copper Boiler</strong>, use Putz Pomade Cream. Apply
      with a woollen cloth when boiler is warm, not hot; then rub off with
      second woollen cloth and polish with flannel or chamois. If badly
      tarnished, use oxalic acid. Faucets and brasses are treated in the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      A bottle containing <strong>Oxalic Acid</strong> should be marked poison,
      and kept on a high shelf.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      To keep an <strong>Ice Chest</strong> in good condition, wash thoroughly
      once a week with cold or lukewarm water in which washing soda has been
      dissolved. If by chance anything is spilt in an ice chest, it should be
      wiped off at once.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Milk and butter very quickly absorb odors, and if in ice chest with other
      foods, should be kept closely covered.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Hard Wood Floors and Furniture</strong> may be polished by using a
      small quantity of kerosene oil applied with a woollen cloth, then rubbing
      with a clean woollen cloth. A very good furniture polish is made by using
      equal parts linseed oil and turpentine.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Polish for Hard Wood Floors.</strong> Use one part beeswax to two
      parts turpentine. Put in saucepan on range, and when wax is dissolved a
      paste will be formed.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      To clean <strong>Piano Keys</strong>, rub over with alcohol.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      To remove old <strong>Tea and Coffee Stains</strong>, wet spot with cold
      water, cover with glycerine, and let stand two or three hours. Then wash
      with cold water and hard soap. Repeat if necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_591">591</span>Before
      <strong>Sweeping Old Carpets</strong>, sprinkle with pieces of newspaper
      wrung out of water. After sweeping, wipe over with a cloth wrung out of a
      weak solution of ammonia water, which seems to brighten colors.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      Platt’s Chloride is one of the best <strong>Disinfectants</strong>.
      Chloride of lime is a valuable disinfectant, and much cheaper than Platt’s
      Chloride.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Listerine</strong> is an excellent disinfectant to use for the
      mouth and throat.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>To Make a Pastry Bag.</strong> Fold a twelve-inch square of rubber
      cloth from two opposite corners. Sew edges together, forming a triangular
      bag. Cut off point to make opening large enough to insert a tin pastry
      tube. A set comprising bag and twelve adjustable tubes may be bought for
      two and one-half dollars.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Smoked Ceilings</strong> may be cleaned by washing with cloths
      wrung out of water in which a small piece of washing soda has been
      dissolved.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>For a Burn</strong> apply equal parts of white of egg and olive
      oil mixed together, then cover with a piece of old linen; if applied at
      once no blister will form. Or apply at once cooking soda, then cover with
      cloth and keep the same wet with cold water. This takes out the pain and
      prevents blistering.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Curtain and Portière Poles</strong> allow the hangings to slip
      easily if rubbed with hard soap. This is much better than greasing.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>Creaking Doors and Drawers</strong> should be treated in the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p class="c008">
      <strong>To Remove Dust from Rattan Furniture</strong> use a painter’s
      small brush.

    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">First Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Little Neck Clams or Bluepoints, with brown-bread sandwiches. Sometimes
      canapés are used in place of either. For a gentleman’s dinner, canapés
      accompanied with Sherry wine are frequently served before guests enter the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Second Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Clear soup, with bread sticks, small rolls, or crisp crackers. Where two
      soups are served, one may be a cream soup. Cream soups are served with
      croûtons. Radishes, celery, or olives are passed after the soup. Salted
      almonds may be passed between any of the courses.

    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Fourth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Fish, baked, boiled, or fried. Cole-slaw, dressed cucumbers, or tomatoes
      accompany this course; with fried fish potatoes are often served.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Fifth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Roast saddle of venison or mutton, spring lamb, or fillet of beef;
      potatoes and one other vegetable.

    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Eighth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Punch or cheese course. Punch, when served, always precedes the game
      course.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Ninth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Game, with vegetable salad, usually lettuce or celery; or cheese sticks
      may be served with the salad, and game omitted.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Tenth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">Dessert, usually cold.</p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Eleventh Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Frozen dessert and fancy cakes. Bonbons are passed after this course.
    </p>
    <h3 class="c018"><span class="sc">Twelfth Course</span></h3>
    <p class="c019">
      Cracker, cheese, and café noir. Café noir is frequently served in the
      drawing and smoking rooms after the dinner.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      Where wines and liquors are served, the first course is not usually
      accompanied by either; but if desired, Sauterne or other white wine may be
      used.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      With soup, serve Sherry; with fish, white wine; with game, Claret; with
      roast and other courses, Champagne.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      <span class="pageno" id="Page_602">602</span>After serving café noir in
      drawing-room, pass pony of brandy for men, sweet liqueur (Chartreuse,
      Benedictine, or Parfait d’Amour) for women; then Crême de Menthe for all.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      After a short time Apollinaris should be passed. White wines should be
      served cool; Sherry should be as near the temperature of the room in which
      it is served as possible. Champagne should be served very cold by allowing
      it to remain in salt and ice at least one-half hour before dinner time.
      Claret, served without cooling, and as it contains so small amount of
      alcohol, is not good the day after opening.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For a simpler dinner, the third, seventh, eighth, and tenth courses, and
      the game in the ninth course, may be omitted.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      For a home dinner, it is always desirable to serve for first course a
      soup; second course, meat or fish, with potatoes and two other vegetables;
      third course, a vegetable salad, with French dressing; fourth course,
      dessert; fifth course, crackers, cheese, and café noir.
    </p>
    <p class="c009">
      At a ladies’ luncheon the courses are as many as at a small dinner. In
      winter, grape fruit is sometimes served in place of oysters; in summer,
      selected strawberries in small Swedish Timbale cases.

      The aim of this School is to afford such instruction as will elevate
      cookery to its proper place as a science and an art. The courses are so
      arranged, combining the practical and the theoretical, that the knowledge
      gained may be applied to daily living. The needs of the body are not
      forgotten. The classification, composition, and nutritive value of foods
      are considered. The correct proportion of each of the food-principles
      necessary for a day’s ration, for those of different age, sex, and
      occupation, is emphasized, thus enabling the pupil to arrange
      well-balanced dietaries. Attention is paid to the selection of supplies
      with reference to economy and utility, thus tending to develop an interest
      in marketing and accounts.

        The greatest invention of the age! A great saving of time, strength, and

        one. By their use the softest dough can be handled without the slightest
        possibility of sticking to moulding board or rolling pin. They are
        guaranteed to be absolutely as represented. One set will last for years.
        They will save many times their cost in material alone. They are highly
        recommended by leading cooks and teachers of cooking.

        A work of exceptional interest and importance is the new book, “Food and
        Cookery for the Sick and Convalescent,” by Fannie Merritt Farmer, the
        author of “The Boston Cooking School Cook Book,” etc. It is designed to
        meet the needs of the trained nurse, the mother, or of any one having
        care of the sick. The work is the result of years of study along the
        lines of food and feeding, and contains much scientific knowledge simply
        given.
      </p>
      <p class="c009">
        The opening chapters are invaluable to those whose duty it is to care
        for the sick, and of equal importance to those who see in correct
        feeding the way of preventing much of the illness about us. The chapter
        on Infant Feeding is an authoritative guide to aid in the development of
        the baby, and child feeding is considered with like care.
      </p>
      <p class="c009">
        The hundreds of recipes, many of which have their caloric value given,
        are for the most part individual, thus requiring but a minimum of time
        for their preparation. Suggestions as to diet in various diseases have
        not been overlooked. Sixty full-page half-tone illustrations add to the
        utility and beauty of the book.

        Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
        law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so
        the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
        States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
        Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this
        license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic
        works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark. Project
        Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge
        for an eBook, except by following the terms of the trademark license,
        including paying royalties for use of the Project Gutenberg trademark.
        If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with
        the trademark license is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly
        any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances
        and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and
        given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with
        eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to
        the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

        electronic works
      </div>
      <div>
        1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic
        work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept
        all the terms of this license and intellectual property
        (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
        terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
        copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you
        paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™
        electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this
        agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you
        paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used
        on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
        to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
        you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
        complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
        below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™
        electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
        preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See
        paragraph 1.E below.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”
        or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
        collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
        individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and
        you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent
        you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
        derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
        Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
        Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works
        by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms
        of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated
        with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
        keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
        Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.
      </div>
      <div>
        1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
        what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
        a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
        the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
        before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
        creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
        Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the
        copyright status of any work in any country other than the United
        States.

      <div>
        1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived
        from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a
        notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright
        holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United
        States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or
        providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”
        associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with
        the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission

        terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked

        active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
        Gutenberg™ License.

        1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
        compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
        word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
        distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than
        “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version
        posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org),
        you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

        request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other

        <li>

          the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
          already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the

          royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary

          marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
          Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information about

          you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does
          not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You
          must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works
          possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all
          access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.
        </li>
        <li>
          • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
          any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
          electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
          receipt of the work.
        </li>
        <li>

        in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the
        Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the

      <div>1.F.</div>
      <div>
        1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
        effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
        works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
        Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
        electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
        contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
        or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
        property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

        Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
        including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
        because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
        people in all walks of life.
      </div>
      <div>
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals
        and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
        available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
        permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn
        more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how
        your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
        Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

        Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
        public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
        number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
        distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
        equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
        $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
        the IRS.
      </div>
      <div>
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
        we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
        DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
        visit
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a
        >.
      </div>
      <div>
        While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
        have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
        against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
        approach us with offers to donate.
      </div>
      <div>
        International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
        statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
        the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
      </div>
      <div>
        Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
        methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
        including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
        please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

        Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
      </div>
      <div>
        Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
        concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
        with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
        Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
      </div>
      <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
